Preface
In April of 2019, members of Le Refuge, a Buddhist group located near
Marseilles, invited me to lead a ten-day retreat on the topic of the ten perfections
(pāramī): giving, virtue, renunciation, discernment, persistence, endurance, truth,
determination, goodwill, and equanimity. In February of this year, members of
Sociedade Vipassanā de Meditação of Brasília asked me to lead a ten-day retreat
on the same topic.
e perfections are a set of qualities traditionally associated with the path of
the bodhisatta—the Buddha-to-be—in his quest for the timeless happiness of
awakening through the course of many lifetimes. Because these perfections are
drawn from the Jātaka tales, stories of the Buddha’s previous lives, and because the
bodhisatta is o en portrayed as a layperson in those tales, the perfections provide
an excellent framework for understanding how to give meaningful and satisfying
purpose to everyday lay life. ey show how to approach duties, responsibilities,
and challenges in a way that’s conducive both to genuine goodness and to genuine
happiness. As they develop, they foster qualities both of a good mind—wise in
understanding cause and eﬀect—and a good heart: purposeful, well-intentioned,
and strong.
e talks of each retreat were presented in two series: a series of talks on the
ten perfections, primarily in the evenings, plus a series of morning talks, largely
on practical issues arising in meditation and topics related to the practical
application of the perfections. Every a ernoon, there was a period for questions
and answers concerning issues arising from the talks and from the retreatants’
experiences in meditation.
e present book is based on the talks from both retreats. In some cases, I have
used transcripts of the talks from the French retreat; in others, transcripts from
the Brazilian retreat; and in still others, an amalgam of the two. I have also
included some of the questions and answers from the Q&A periods from both
retreats, placed immediately a er the talks to which they seem most clearly
related. e talks, questions, and answers have been edited and expanded so as to



3

make their coverage of the main topics of the retreats more complete than I was
able to manage on the spot.
e talks draw on suttas, or discourses, from the Pāli Canon and on the
writings and talks of the ajaans, or teachers, of the ai forest tradition, in which
I was trained. For people unfamiliar with the Canon, I have added passages from
the discourses at the back of the book to esh out some of the points made in the
talks. ese are followed by a glossary of Pāli terms.
For people unfamiliar with the ai forest tradition, you should know that it
is a meditation tradition founded in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
century by Ajaan Sao Kantasīlo and Ajaan Mun Bhūridatto. e ajaans
mentioned in the talks trained under Ajaan Mun. Of these, Ajaan Fuang Jotiko
and Ajaan Suwat Suvaco were my teachers. Ajaan Fuang, although he spent some
time training directly under Ajaan Mun, spent more time training under one of
Ajaan Mun’s students, Ajaan Lee Dhammadharo.
Many people have helped with the preparation of this book. In particular, I
would like to thank the people of Le Refuge and the Sociedade Vipassanā de
Meditação who made the retreats possible; my interpreters, Khamaṇo Bhikkhu
( an Lionel) in France and Katatto Bhikkhu ( an Saulo) in Brazil; Philippe
and Watthani Cortey-Dumont, who hosted my entire stay in France; and
members of the Karuṇā Group, who hosted my stay in and around Brasília. Here
at Metta, the monks at the monastery helped in preparing the manuscript, as did
Addie Onsanit, Christopher James, Virginia Lawrence, Anita Basu, Irfan Pirbhai,
and Isabella Trauttmansdorﬀ. Any mistakes in the book, of course, are my own
responsibility.

DAY ONE
EVENING

Introduction
Good evening and welcome to our retreat on the ten perfections. It’s always a
pleasure to come and meditate with you here, and I hope the retreat is helpful for
you all.
e ten perfections are a list of teachings that provide focus for living everyday
life in a way that has meaning and purpose, at the same time developing the path
to awakening. is emphasis on purpose is in line with the nature of the mind
itself, which is purposeful. To be happy, the mind requires a good purpose. e
perfections pose questions that force you to re ect on what kind of purpose you
already live for, and whether you might do better to aim at something higher.
e questions they ask are:
What kind of happiness do you want to set as a goal in your life?
Is your current behavior actually taking you there or somewhere else?
If it’s taking you somewhere else, what do you need to change?
e answer given by the ten perfections to these questions is that true
happiness can be gained through human action, but it lies in a dimension beyond
the con nes of space, time, and change. It’s the best possible goal. In some cases, it
can be attained in this life, but in others it may take two lifetimes or many more.
So, the perfections ask you to take the attitude of a marathon runner. Pace
yourself and be ready for the long term so that you don’t give up before you’ve
arrived at the goal.
All of the Buddha’s teachings—his Dhamma—are goal-oriented. is is
re ected in the fact that the word Dhamma is o en paired with the word attha,
which means “meaning,” “purpose,” “bene t,” or “goal.” All of these meanings of
attha are connected. To know the meaning of the Dhamma is not just a matter of
interpreting its words in terms of other words. You also have to know its purpose:
how the teaching is supposed to be acted on, and where it’s supposed to lead you
when you act on it correctly. In fact, you won’t really know the fullness of the


5

meaning of the Dhamma until you’ve had a direct experience of the goal. To reach
that experience, you have to ask, with regard to every teaching: “What is this
teaching for? How do I act on it correctly? And when I do, where will it take
me?” en act accordingly.
To understand the goal of the ten perfections, we should rst look at two
approaches to life that the Buddha did not take, because sometimes they are
falsely attributed to him.
e rst is that there is nothing to attain, that we should reject the desire for
something better than what we presently experience as unrealistic, and instead
nd contentment in accepting things as they already are.
A while back, I was watching an interview in which a Dhamma teacher was
saying just that: that happiness lies in simply relaxing and accepting things as they
are, with the realization that they cannot be changed. e woman who was
interviewing the teacher said, “But isn’t this defeatist and pessimistic?” And the
teacher said, “Only if you think about it.”
Now, the Buddha was not defeatist, and there are no images in the Canon of
relaxing your way to awakening. All of its images are of search, struggle, and
mastering skills. As the Buddha said, the path is a path of victory. “Unexcelled
victory in battle,” he called it. And he certainly didn’t say not to think. We end
desire not through resignation, but by using our discernment to strategize, to nd
a path to a happiness so complete that there’s no more need for desire. It’s found,
not by lowering your standards, but by nding good standards and then raising
them. To do that, you have to expand your imagination as to what you are able to
do.
e second approach that the Buddha didn’t take was the materialist
approach, claiming that the death of the body is the end of consciousness, so that
we have to nd our goal solely in this life. is perspective might lead us to nd
meaning in creating a better society where people can live a moral life, with all its
anxieties and vulnerabilities. is, however, does not solve the major problem in
life, which is that we’re driven rst by our hungers. We live by feeding on one
another.
One of the images that occurred to the Buddha before he began his quest for
awakening was of many sh in a stream. e stream is drying up, and the sh are
ghting one another over that last little bit of water, yet even the sh who succeed



6

in pushing the others out of the way are going to end up dying anyhow. If this
were all there was to life, it would be pretty depressing.
e problem with the relaxed, accepting approach and the materialist
approach is that both see suﬀering as a necessary part of life that simply has to be
accepted. is is precisely what the Buddha did not accept. He aspired to freedom
from suﬀering and from the need to feed.
e materialist view also diﬀers from the Buddha’s approach in that it starts
with an assumption about the relationship between body and mind—that the
body comes prior to the mind—and from there draws some conclusions about
what we can do and know. e Buddha’s approach was the other way around. He
started by mastering skills that allowed him to do and know more than he had
ever done and known before: putting an end to suﬀering and realizing a timeless
happiness. en—in the course of mastering those skills—he made some radical
discoveries about how the body and mind are related.
One of his discoveries was that consciousness does not need a body to survive.
Consciousness and craving feed on one another in such a way that they can keep
each other going beyond the death of the body, from lifetime to lifetime,
inde nitely. is was not an idea that the Buddha had simply picked up from
Indian culture. ere were many materialists in ancient India. So, in teaching
rebirth, he was not adopting, without thinking, an idea universally accepted in
his culture. It was a hotly debated issue in his time.
He also discovered that actions have results that lead beyond this life, and the
results follow the pattern of cause and eﬀect based on the quality of the intention
behind the act. Because intentions come from the mind, this puts the mind rst.
Here it’s important to note that the word for mind in Pāli, citta, can also mean
heart. In other words, we’re looking at the mind/heart both as something that
thinks and understands, and as something that desires. From the Buddha’s
perspective, these two functions are not totally separate. Our thoughts are shaped
by our desires, and our desires by our thoughts. In particular, the act of forming
an intention uses both sides of the mind/heart. Each intention is based on a
desire to attain a goal, informed by our understanding of what is possible and
how, given what’s possible, it can best be attained.
e practice of developing the perfections is one where we train our mind to
be good so that it has a correct understanding of cause and eﬀect, and of how to
use cause and eﬀect to attain a wise goal. We also train our heart to be good, both


7

in the sense of desiring a well-being that causes no harm, and in the sense of
having the strength to carry through with that desire. en we combine that good
mind and good heart to produce intentional actions that are skillful and
coherent, leading to the best possible goal: a happiness that has no need to feed.
Only then can we be truly harmless and safe.
e Buddha discovered that this goal is possible and he presented it as a
challenge: Do you want to live life without trying to see whether it’s true? He says
that we have a potential power in our hands. Don’t you want to see how far it can
take you toward awakening to the end of suﬀering?
e perfections we’ll be discussing in the course of this retreat are qualities of
heart and mind needed to arrive at that awakening. If we desire true happiness,
their development should take priority in our lives, requiring that we trade short-
term comfort for long-term happiness.
e ten perfections are these: giving, virtue, renunciation, discernment,
persistence, endurance or patience, truth, determination, goodwill, and
equanimity. You’ll notice that these are qualities both of a good mind and of a
good heart. We try to bring wise understanding to the desires of the heart so that,
as they work together, they can shape intentions that are noble and good.
ese qualities are also strengths, and many of them are listed in the suttas as
treasures. ey teach us to regard the challenges of life not as obstacles, but as
opportunities to make our hearts and minds wealthy and strong.
e role and importance of the perfections is re ected in the Pāli word for
perfection: pāramī. It can either mean “foremost,” para, or it can be related to “to
the other side,” paraṁ. In other words, the ten perfections take priority for
anyone who is aiming to go beyond suﬀering, to nd unbinding or true freedom
on the other side of the ood of birth and death.
e purpose of this retreat will be to provide some understanding of the
perfections and to give an opportunity to put them into practice through
meditation. We ask that, for the duration of the retreat, you take as a working
hypothesis the Buddha’s understanding of the mind that underlies his teaching of
the perfections. is will give you an opportunity to look at your life from the
perspective that this understanding provides.
Basically, the Buddha’s perspective is that if we train the mind and heart to be
truly good, we will also be truly happy. Happiness and goodness, when they’re


8

genuine, go naturally together. e Buddha’s insight here is very diﬀerent from
the perspective of contemporary culture, which says that true happiness isn’t
possible. “Buy our goods instead,” they say. “Content yourself with what we can
sell you.” ere are also many currents in our society saying that being truly good
is neither possible nor wise. So, by adopting the perfections, we free ourselves
from the cynical attitude we see so prevalent around us.

As for the organization of the retreat: In the evening we’ll have talks on the
ten perfections. e morning talks will be primarily practical talks on meditation
and other issues related to the perfections. However, because there are ten
perfections and only eight nights, some of the perfections will be allocated to the
mornings. We’ll also have opportunities for questions and answers. But because
there are way too many people to just raise your hands, we’ll have slips of paper
for you to write your questions on and a bowl for you to put the questions in. We
will answer the questions as the schedule allows.
Given the way that the retreat is organized, there are a couple of perfections
that won’t come until the end of the retreat, but it’s good to talk about them
brie y now. For example, equanimity and endurance: We have lots of people in
this room, and I understand we’re going to get a lot of rain this week. So, we’ll
have plenty of opportunities to practice endurance and equanimity. Many of the
ajaans in ailand have said of Westerners that endurance and equanimity are our
weak points. Here’s our chance to prove them wrong.
Another perfection worth noting as we begin is the perfection of
renunciation. It, too, won’t be discussed for several days, but it’s precisely the
perfection under which meditation comes. So, we’re going to start meditating
right now in order to give you some practical basis for understanding the
discussions of renunciation and also the relationship of meditation to the other
perfections as we come to them.

GUIDED MEDITATION

Close your eyes; get in position. Spread thoughts of goodwill. Goodwill is a
wish for true happiness. e Buddha connected it with discernment. He said that
any time you have ill will for someone else, it’s a sign of wrong view. And because




9

the teaching is all about nding true happiness, goodwill underlies all the
perfections.
So, start with goodwill for yourself. Tell yourself, “May I be truly happy.”
ink for a minute about what that means. Happiness doesn’t simply come from
the wish. It comes from our actions. So, when you’re wishing goodwill for
yourself, you’re telling yourself, “May I understand the causes for true happiness,
and may I be willing and able to act on them.”
en spread the same thought to others. Start with people who are close to
your heart: your family, your very close friends. May they nd true happiness, too.
en spread those thoughts out in ever-widening circles: to people you know
well and like, to people you like even though you don’t know them so well, to
people you’re more neutral about, and to people you don’t like. Remember that
goodwill in this case means that if these people have been behaving in very bad
ways, you’re wishing that they learn how to change their ways for the better—
which is something you can wish for everyone without any hypocrisy.
Spread thoughts of goodwill to people you don’t even know. And not just
people—living beings of all kinds: east, west, north, south, above, and below, out
to in nity. May we all nd true happiness in our hearts.
Now bring your thoughts to the breath. e word “breath” in this context
doesn’t mean just the air coming in and out of the lungs. It also means the ow of
energy in the body, which exists on many levels, the most obvious being the
energy that allows the breath to come in and go out.
So, take a couple of good, long, deep in-and-out breaths and notice where you
feel the energy of the breath most prominently in the body. If long breathing feels
good, you can keep up that rhythm. If it doesn’t feel good, you can change. You
can experiment to see what kind of breathing feels best for the body right now:
long or short, fast or slow, deep or shallow, heavy or light, coarse or re ned.
If your mind leaves the breath to follow another thought, drop that thought
and you’ll nd yourself right back at the breath. If the mind wanders oﬀ 10 times
or 100 times, drop those thoughts 10 times or 100 times. Don’t get discouraged.
Each time you come back to the breath, reward yourself with a breath that feels
particularly gratifying. at way, the mind will be more and more inclined to
want to come back. If there are any pains anywhere in the body, don’t focus on




10

them. Instead, focus on the parts of the body that you can make comfortable with
the breathing.
Now, as the breath gets comfortable, there will sometimes be a tendency to
leave the breath to focus on the sense of comfort, in which case you lose the basis
for your concentration. So, to counteract that tendency, as soon as the breath gets
comfortable, the next step is to breathe in and out aware of the entire body. And a
good way to work up to that full-body awareness is to go through the body,
section by section, to notice how the breathing feels in diﬀerent parts of the body.
Start down around the navel. Locate that part of the body in your awareness.
Watch it for a while to see how it feels as you breathe in and breathe out. Notice
what kind of breathing feels good right there. If you notice any tension or
tightness in that part of the body, allow it to relax, so that no new tension builds
up as you breathe in, and you don’t hold on to any tension as you breathe out.
Now move your attention over to the right, to the lower right-hand corner of
the abdomen and follow the same steps there.
One, locate that part of the body in your awareness. Two, watch it for a while
as you breathe in and breathe out to see what kind of breathing feels good there.
And three, if there’s any sense of tension or tightness there, allow it to relax.
Now move your attention over to the le , to the lower le -hand corner of the
abdomen, and follow the same three steps there.
Now bring your attention up to the solar plexus, right at the tip of the
breastbone, and follow the same three steps there.
Now bring your attention over to the right, to the right ank.
And then to the le , to the le ank.
en bring your attention to the middle of the chest. Try to be especially
sensitive to how the breath energy feels around the heart, and breathe in a way
that feels soothing there.
Now bring your attention to the right, to the place where the chest and the
shoulder meet.
And then to the same spot on the le .
Now bring your attention to the base of the throat.
Now bring your attention to the middle of the head. As you breathe in and
out, think of the breath energy coming in and out of the head from all directions,


11

not only through the nose, but also through the eyes, the ears, in from the back of
the head, down from the top of the head, going deep, deep, deep into the brain,
gently dissolving away any patterns of tension you may feel anywhere in the head:
around the jaws, around the forehead, around the eyes, at the back of the neck.
Now bring your attention to the base of the neck, right at the base of the skull.
As you breathe in, think of the breath energy entering there from the back and
spreading down through the neck, down the shoulders, the arms, out to the tips
of the ngers. As you breathe out, think of it radiating out from all those parts of
the body into the air.
As you get more sensitive to these parts of the body, if you see that one side is
holding more tension than the other, relax that side and try to keep it relaxed, all
the way through the in-breath, all the way through the out-.
As blatant patterns of tension begin to relax in these parts of the body, try to
become more sensitive to subtler patterns of tension that were obscured by the
more blatant ones. Allow even the slightest tension that you can detect to relax.
Now, keeping your attention focused on the back of the neck, this time as you
breathe in, think of the energy entering there and then going down both sides of
the spine all the way down to the tailbone. en, as you breathe out, think of it
radiating out from the entire spine into the air. Again, if you notice that there’s
more tension in one side of the back than the other, allow that side to relax. And
try to keep becoming more and more sensitive even to the slightest patterns of
tension in this part of the body. When you sense them, allow them to relax.
Now bring your attention down to the tailbone. As you breathe in, think of
the energy entering there and going down through the hips, the legs, to the tips of
the toes. And then as you breathe out, think of the energy radiating out from all
those parts of the body into the air. And again, if there’s more tension in one side
of the body than the other, allow that side to relax. And keep it relaxed, all the
way through the in-breath, all the way through the out-. As you’re staying here,
try to become sensitive to ever more subtle patterns of tension so that you can
dissolve those away, too.
at completes one cycle in the survey of the body. If you were meditating on
your own, you could go through the body as many times as you like. But for the
time being, nd one spot where it seems most congenial to focus your attention.
Focus your attention there and then, from that spot, let your awareness ll the



12

entire body, so that you’re aware of the whole body as you breathe in, the whole
body as you breathe out.
e range of your awareness may have the tendency to shrink, especially on
the out-breath. So, each time you breathe in, remind yourself, “Whole body.”
Each time you breathe out, “Whole body.” Allow the breath to nd whatever
rhythm feels comfortable. ere’s nothing else you have to do right now, nothing
else you have to think about. Just try to maintain this sense of centered but broad
awareness. It’s healing for the body, healing for the mind, and it provides a good
basis for insight to arise. But for the moment, don’t worry about insights. Simply
try to make this foundation as solid as you can.
[Meditation]
Before you leave meditation, think thoughts of goodwill once more. ink of
whatever sense of peace or well-being you’ve felt during the past session and
dedicate it to others: either to speci c people who you know who are suﬀering
right now or to all living beings in all directions. May we all nd peace and well-
being in our hearts.
And with that thought, you can open your eyes.

QUESTIONS

Q: Could you give the Pāli term for each perfection?
A: Dāna is giving, sīla is virtue, nekkhama is renunciation, paññā is
discernment, viriya is persistence, khanti is endurance or patience, sacca is truth,
adhiṭṭhāna is determination, mettā is goodwill, and upekkhā is equanimity.

Q: What is the relationship between the perfections and kamma?
A: ey’re qualities of mind that will determine whether you will make good
kamma or bad kamma—in other words, good or bad intentional actions.
Everything in the Buddha’s teachings except for nibbāna is related to kamma.

Q: You touched on something about the relationship between renunciation
and meditation. It sounds very important, but you didn’t explain it. Can you
explain more about that?




13

A: When you get the mind into concentration, you have to put aside all of
your interest in sensual thinking. at’s precisely what renunciation is. When the
Buddha’s talking about sensuality, he’s not talking about sensual pleasures. He’s
talking about our fascination with thinking about sensual pleasures. For example,
you may be thinking that when our evening session is over you can go into the
nearby town and get some ice cream. Your fascination with thinking about the ice
cream: at’s the sensuality. e ice cream itself is not sensuality. Only if you
drop that kind of thinking can you get the mind into right concentration. At the
same time, the only way to overcome sensuality is to provide the mind with a
better, non-sensual pleasure, and the concentration is precisely what provides that
pleasure. at’s how renunciation and concentration practice are related to each
other.

Q: ere are practice lineages of meditation that tell you to keep the eyes half-
open when you meditate in order to not separate yourself from the world, in light
of the fact that our life and our activities take place within the world with our
eyes open.
A: When you meditate, you can have your eyes open, half-opened, or closed:
It doesn’t make any diﬀerence. Do whatever seems best for keeping your mind
both calm and awake. However, it’s good to remember that when you meditate,
you are taking time out from the world—because you have a problem that the
world cannot solve, and only you can solve it for yourself. at’s the problem of
the unnecessary suﬀering you cause for yourself. is is a problem that happens in
a part of your awareness that no one else can know directly. In other words, no
one else can experience your suﬀering.
e solution to this problem comes from qualities that lie within your mind,
again, in the part that no one else can know. So, allow yourself to have some time
out from the world so that you can focus your attention fully on the problem you
need to solve. If the world keeps pushing in, you have to push back. And watch
out for meditation lineages that tell you that your ful llment will happen within
the world, because they won’t condone your spending the time you need to solve
the problem that you have to solve. If you don’t solve it, you’ll keep on suﬀering,
and that suﬀering will spill out onto others as well.

Q: Is the Buddhist path the same for everyone?


14

A: Everyone will have to develop the same perfections. Some people will have
to work harder on some perfections than others. And some people, in addition to
gaining awakening, will develop other psychic abilities as well. But the path to
awakening itself is always the same.

Q: How should one nd the purpose of one’s life?
A: Fortunately, you are the person who can decide what your purpose is going
to be. In other words, it’s not a pre-ordained purpose you have to nd. It’s a
purpose you choose. In the Buddhist cosmology, there’s no one in charge. ere’s
no one assigning a purpose to other beings, which means that you’re free to
choose what you think is the best goal in your life. Now, your past kamma may
make it diﬃcult to attain that goal in this lifetime, but if the goal is good, don’t
let that discourage you. Just because a path of practice is easy doesn’t mean that it
takes you where you want to go. And just because a path has obstacles doesn’t
mean that you shouldn’t try to follow it.

Q: An awareness that is freed from the body and its cravings: Is that
awakening?
A: ere are states of mind where we’re not aware of the body and we don’t
see any cravings, but it is possible for the cravings to be there, simply that they’re
not showing themselves. ey’ve gone underground. at’s not a state of
awakening. Awakening is a mind where the possibility of craving has been
uprooted.

DAY TWO
MORNING

An Overview
is morning I’d like to give an overview of the ten perfections.
As you remember, the perfections are these: giving, virtue, renunciation,
discernment, persistence, endurance, truth, determination, goodwill, and
equanimity. is list does not come from the original suttas. Individual
perfections are taught in the suttas, o en to monks and laypeople, but the list as a
whole comes from a later period, probably just before the Canon was closed,
about two or three hundred years a er the Buddha passed away.
e list is associated with the Jātaka tales, which are tales of the Buddha’s
lifetimes prior to his last one. In these tales, he’s usually a layperson, which is why
the perfections are useful guides for re ecting on how to live lay life in a way that
leads to awakening. ere are a few Jātaka tales in the early parts of the Canon
but, over time, more and more tales were added to the original ones. As diﬀerent
schools of Buddhism began to develop, each added a separate collection of Jātaka
tales to its version of the Canon.
As a result, there are diﬀerent collections of Jātakas from the diﬀerent early
schools of Buddhism. ese, in turn, resulted in diﬀerent lists of the perfections.
One school, called the Sarvāstivādins, listed six perfections, a list that was later
adopted by the Mahāyāna: giving, virtue, endurance, persistence, jhāna (mental
absorption), and discernment.
In all the early schools, many pan-Indian tales with well-known heroes were
added to the Jātakas. For example, Rama is included as a previous lifetime of the
Buddha. is was perhaps to help Buddhist converts sense that, in adopting
Buddhism, they were not abandoning the good elements of their cultural
heritage. If this had happened in France, they might have included the story of
d’Artagnan. Had it happened in the British Isles, they probably would have
included Robin Hood and King Arthur. So, as you can imagine, it’s quite an
eclectic group of tales.



16

Still, even though the Jātaka tales may not represent actual lives of the
Buddha, they do re ect the values of the people who collected them—people
trained in the values that the Buddha taught.
While the diﬀerent schools were compiling their collections, they asked
themselves, “What can we learn about the Buddha’s path of practice from these
tales? What are the qualities that he developed in each case?” ese are the
questions that led to the list of the perfections. Now, as you’ll nd, the individual
perfections in each of the two mains lists are also found in the arahant path as
de ned in various suttas. e question then arose, what is the relationship of the
Buddha’s path to the arahant’s path? Was the diﬀerence quantitative or
qualitative? “ uantitative,” here, means that arahants developed the same
perfections as the Buddha, but the Buddha simply developed more of each.
“ ualitative” means that the perfections for the Buddha were actually of a
diﬀerent type.
e eravāda and other early schools decided that the diﬀerence was
quantitative. e Mahāyāna, which came later, decided that it was qualitative,
speci cally in the case of discernment. e discernment developed by the
Buddha, they said, was radically diﬀerent from the discernment developed by the
arahants. Instead of discernment into how things arise and pass away, which
would be the arahant’s discernment, the Mahāyāna schools taught that the
ultimate discernment—the Buddha’s perfection of discernment—was that things
don’t really arise or pass away. is diﬀerence informed all the rest of the
Mahāyāna perfections.
Even within the eravāda, there are some diﬀerences between the Dhamma
as taught in the Jātaka tales and as taught in the suttas. For instance, discernment
in the Jātakas is more a matter of cleverness than of right view. But the Jātakas do
share with the suttas the idea that discernment should be strategic.
ere is also the issue that the actions of the bodhisatta—the future Buddha
as portrayed in the Jātakas—are not always a reliable guide to good behavior.
Sometimes he kills, sometimes he steals, sometimes he has illicit sex, sometimes
he drinks, although he never lies—and we’ll come back to that point later when
we discuss virtue. e eravāda interpretation of the Jātakas explains these
ethical lapses by saying that because he wasn’t yet awakened, he still didn’t fully
understand the Dhamma. In English, we’d say that he was still learning the ropes.



17

ere’s also an issue in that the perfections are never explained in the Jātakas.
ey simply say that the Buddha-to-be had these qualities, but they rarely explain
how or why a particular tale exhibits a particular perfection. is is why, for the
purpose of this retreat, we’re going to be looking at the individual perfections—
what they are and how they’re developed—as they’re explained in the suttas and
also in the teachings of some of the forest ajaans.
ere’s one other problematic feature of the list: ere’s no clear progression
from one perfection to the next. So, to bring the list into line with a list the
Buddha did teach—and to give an organic unity to the discussion—we’ll
organize the perfections under the framework of what the Buddha called the four
determinations. is means that we’ll be looking at all ten perfections under the
framework provided by one of the perfections, which is determination.
e four determinations are these:
• not to neglect discernment,
• to guard the truth,
• to be devoted to relinquishment, and
• to train for calm.
If you place the ten perfections under these four categories,
• under discernment you would have discernment and goodwill,
• under truth: truth, virtue, and persistence,
• under relinquishment: giving and renunciation, and
• under calm: endurance and equanimity.
is placement is somewhat arbitrary, in that some of the perfections could t
under a variety of categories. Equanimity and renunciation, for instance, can also
be seen as aspects of discernment. Virtue is taught in the Canon as a form of
giving: the gi of safety. However, the fact that these perfections could t under a
number of categories simply underlines the point that there is an organic unity to
the practice of the perfections and that each perfection contains elements of the
others.
is is the rst point emphasized by this way of organizing the material: Each
perfection contains elements of the others.
e second point is that, as with every determination, all of the perfections
grow from an act of will. is is in line with the Buddha’s observation that all
phenomena are rooted in desire. We have to want the perfections for them to


18

come true. ey are qualities of the heart and mind that we can choose to develop
consistently to pursue the goal we’ve chosen, which is awakening.
It’s important that we realize that we’re always making choices and that they
matter. Awakening is not the inevitable result of our true nature, nor is it our
entitlement. We have the potentials for the perfections in our hearts and minds,
but we also have the potential for their opposites. ere are some times when
goodwill, for example, comes naturally, but there are other times when ill will is
equally—or even more—natural. All you have to do is look at the behavior of
little children, and you can see that both goodwill and ill will are very natural—
which means that if we want these perfections to develop, we have to make the
choice to develop them, and we have to stick with that choice to go beyond what’s
natural to something better than natural.
is is why, when we discuss the perfections, we will start each discussion by
identifying the desire that underlies our determination to develop that perfection
as part of our quest for awakening.
Determination is basically a focused desire. It’s an attempt to bring our
random desires into some kind of order, to give priority to some over others, so
that our con icting desires don’t work at cross-purposes and get in the way of
what we really want.
at’s the second point.
e third point is that the perfections begin with discernment. e reason we
don’t get what we desire in life, even though experience is rooted in desire, is
because our desires are ignorant of how cause and eﬀect really work. ey don’t
know which causes are skillful—leading to genuinely good results—and which
ones are not. So, for desires to lead to happiness, they have to be guided by right
view and right resolve—the rst two factors of the noble eightfold path. You have
to see that it is possible and worthwhile to develop each perfection. is requires
the ability to imagine that true happiness is possible and that you’re capable of
attaining it. At the same time, discernment gives guidance in how to bring these
perfections about. For example, goodwill, generosity, and persistence are qualities
with which we’re already familiar, but they have to be informed by discernment if
they’re going to become genuine skills. at’s why discernment has to come rst.
However, in actual practice, we’ll also nd that, as we develop the other
perfections, our discernment develops further as well. In other words, the
perfections develop reciprocally. ey help one another along. Discernment gives


19

guidance to the other perfections, at the same time that the act of developing the
other perfections helps to make our discernment more penetrating and precise.
For example, you don’t really know the truth of right view until you’ve followed
through with right resolve and mastered the appropriate tasks assigned by right
view. You don’t really know the truth of craving until you’ve learned how to
abandon it. You don’t know the truth of the path until you’ve developed it to see
that, yes, it really does lead to the end of suﬀering.
is type of knowledge brings together the two meanings of the Pāli word
attha. Attha can mean the meaning of a word or teaching—how it can be
translated into other words—but it also means the goal to which a teaching is
aimed. As I’ve already noted, both meanings apply to the Dhamma at the same
time, in the sense that you don’t really know the meaning of the Dhamma until
you’ve had at least some experience of the goal to which it leads.
is means that discernment has to begin with conviction. In other words, the
teaching sounds good, it makes good sense, but you don’t really know how true it
is until you’ve reaped the rewards of the path. at kind of con rmed knowledge
comes only with the practice. And to practice the perfections, you have to be
convinced that they’re at least worth a try. e proof of these teachings lies in
developing them and enjoying the results they yield. at’s when you’ll see for
yourself that by giving priority to the perfections—not only as you meditate, but
also as you ful ll the duties in your daily life, in your family and at work—they
really are bene cial to you and to the people around you.
So, try to keep in mind the three lessons taught by the way we’re organizing
the discussion of the perfections:
• Each perfection contains the others.
• ey all require focused desire in order to develop.
• In each case, they have to be informed by discernment in order to lead to
awakening. In other words, to get the most out of developing each perfection, you
have to understand what it is and how it ts in with the others. But for your
understanding to be fully developed, it has to learn from the process of
developing the others.
If we think of understanding as a quality of the mind, and the desire to nd
true happiness as a quality of the heart, we can see that the perfections show us
how the development of the heart and mind together can lead to a happiness



20

that’s genuinely satisfying—a happiness that’s good for you and for the people
around you.

QUESTIONS

Q: Is it good to regard the ten perfections as new members of the committee
of the mind?
A: Actually, they already are members of the committee, simply that they may
be weak at the moment. What you’re trying to do as you develop them is to take
these weak members and train them so they have more power in the committee.
is is your strategy for going beyond the perfections towards awakening.

Q: What is the diﬀerence between relinquishment and renunciation?
A: “Relinquishment” is the word we use to translate the Pāli term cāga.
Renunciation we use for nekkhama. e terms in English are very similar, but the
Pāli terms are diﬀerent.
Cāga basically means giving up either a thing or an attitude: You can give up a
desire; you can give up a de lement; you can give up your BMW. Each of these
actions would be a form of relinquishment. Nekkhama means speci cally giving
up thoughts of sensuality. Sensuality is not so much a matter of sensual pleasures
as it is your fascination with thinking about sensual pleasures. We tend to be
more attached to our thoughts and plans about sensual pleasures than we are to
the pleasures themselves.
For instance, suppose you decide to sneak out tonight to get some pizza in
town. You could sit here for the rest of the day thinking about what kind of pizza
you want. When you get to town, it turns out the pizza restaurant is closed. But
that doesn’t matter. Other restaurants are open, and you can go for the pleasure of
some other sort of food instead. However, if I were to say that for the next ve
hours you cannot think about pizza at all, we would have a rebellion. Once you
decide that you want to think about something, you tend to be very attached to
your freedom to think those thoughts. But, as the Buddha said, this kind of
thinking tends to weaken the mind. When you tell yourself, “I’ll be happy only if
the conditions are this, this, this, and this,” you’re like a hothouse plant: Your
happiness can survive only under certain controlled conditions—conditions that
could change and go out of control at any time. When we’re practicing


21

meditation, this kind of thinking is one of the rst things we have to put aside. If
you can substitute those thoughts with the skills of meditation, then you can use
those skills to make yourself happy in any situation.

Q: In the ten perfections, there is the perfection of virtue. What kind of virtue
is this?
A: Essentially, the virtue of restraint or of avoiding harm to others and to
yourself. is means no killing, no stealing, no illicit sex, no lying, and no taking
of intoxicants. is kind of virtue is paired with the perfection of generosity, in
which you actively go out of your way to be helpful to others.

Q: Of the four brahmavihāras—mettā, karuṇā, muditā, upekkhā—two of
them, mettā, goodwill, and upekkhā, equanimity, are also perfections. Why are
compassion, karuṇā, and empathetic joy, muditā, not perfections?
A: Because compassion and empathetic joy actually come under mettā, or
goodwill. Goodwill is a wish that all beings be happy. Compassion is what your
goodwill feels when you see that someone is suﬀering. Empathetic joy is what
your goodwill feels when you see that someone already is happy and you want
that person to continue in that happiness. So, in actuality, all four brahmavihāras
are included in the perfections.

Q: To which perfection does the practice of bowing belong?
A: It belongs to the perfection of giving. You give respect, because it’s in an
atmosphere of respect that you’re most likely to learn. When you bow down, it’s
not a sign that you’re going to obey the person you’re bowing to. It’s simply a sign
of respect and of a willingness to learn.

Q: Sati, or mindfulness, appears in many parts of the 37 Wings to
Awakening. How does it t into the ten perfections?
A: Sati is a faculty of the memory, your active memory: what you keep in
mind as you’re acting on a particular problem. Right sati has two functions in the
path. In its rst function, it applies to all parts of the path and works together
with right view and with right eﬀort to develop the path. With every factor of the
path, you try to have the right view as to what is skillful and what is unskillful.
en right mindfulness (or right sati) remembers what is skillful and what is


22

unskillful, how to deal with skillful qualities in order to develop them and how to
deal with unskillful qualities so that you can abandon them. Right eﬀort is what
actually does the work of developing and abandoning.
In a similar way, sati functions in relationship to every one of the perfections:
You have to remember what the perfections are, the fact that you should develop
them, and whatever lessons you’ve learned from the past in how to develop them
and to abandon their opposites.
e other function of sati is its speci c role in giving rise to right
concentration. In this case, sati would be a part of the perfection of renunciation.

Q: Considering that mindfulness means keeping something in mind, how do
we use mindfulness in a skillful way to develop the ten perfections?
A: You have to keep in mind the desire that you want to develop these ten
perfections, so that when you meet up with challenges in your life you remember
to tell yourself, “ is is nothing to get upset about. is is an opportunity to
develop the perfections.” In fact, there’s a ai saying: “No obstacles, no
perfections.” Let that thought give you encouragement. en, as you’ve been able
to develop a perfection well in that situation, you hold that skill in mind for the
next time you’re faced with a similar challenge.
Remember, too, that all of the perfections are a form of determination, and
with every determination, you have to keep remembering it as contrary desires
come up in the mind. It’s in this way that the development of the perfections is a
form of mindfulness.

Q: What is the common thread among all ten perfections that allows you to
apply them in daily life?
A: e common thread is that you always have to think about the long-term
consequences of what you’re doing, and to remember that the most important
aspect of any activity is what qualities it develops in your own mind. For instance,
suppose you’re at work. Your boss has said something really stupid and
infuriating. You have to ask yourself, “What would be the best thing for me to say
right now that would give the best long-term results?” Now, you may be able to
think of a very clever, sarcastic reply, but then you have to ask yourself, “If I let
this out of my mouth, what will happen? What kind of person will I become?
What kinds of qualities will I be developing?” at’s a simple example.


23

So, think about the long-term consequences of what you’re doing—and we’re
talking really long-term: throughout this lifetime and into future ones. at’s the
perspective that the perfections provide.
Another example would be one that actually comes from the life of one of my
students when I was in ailand. He kept wanting to go into the forest. He said,
“Here in the monastery there are too many distractions.” And that was a forest
monastery! Finally, he got into the forest, and his meditation was miserable.
Fortunately, he was able to realize, “Well, at least I’m developing the perfection of
patience and endurance.” Remembering that purpose can carry you through a lot
of diﬃculties.

EVENING

Determination
As I said this morning, the perfection that will provide the framework for our
discussion during the retreat is the perfection of determination. is is in line
with the Buddha’s observation that all phenomena are rooted in desire. e aim
of desire is to gain pleasure, happiness, and ease, and to avoid suﬀering and pain.
In other words, it starts with discontent. You don’t like the pain from which you
may be suﬀering, and you’re dissatis ed with the pleasure you’re experiencing.
You want something better.
Now, it’s true that desire can be a cause for suﬀering, but it can also function as
part of the path to the end of suﬀering. Or to put it in diﬀerent terms, there’s a
type of discontent that causes suﬀering, but there’s also a type of discontent that
motivates the path. e desire and discontent that motivate the path are the ones
we’ll be focusing on this evening.
ere are so many pleasures in life and so many pains that it’s impossible to
gain all pleasures and avoid all pains. At the same time, some pleasures, when you
pursue them, make it impossible to gain other pleasures. For example, if you want
to be respected by admirable people while you also want to have four or ve
aﬀairs, you’ll have to give up one of those two desires. It’s like planting diﬀerent
plants in your garden: Some plants grow well together; others don’t. If you plant
eucalyptus trees in your garden, they’ll kill everything else.


24

is means that we have to choose which desires are worth following and
which ones are not. is, in turn, requires negotiating among our desires to
choose which pleasures are better le unattained and which pains have to be
endured. In making this negotiation, we decide on the basis of the reasons or
rationales that the mind oﬀers for each desire. is means that the desires are not
pure id (i.e., raw, brute craving). To succeed in this negotiation that constantly
occurs in the mind, each desire has to have some element of reason. Some of the
reasons may not be all that skillful, but there is a reason for every desire. is is
why reason can be used to negotiate and choose among the desires.
Choosing among things always involves a trade: Something has to be
abandoned to gain something else, ideally of higher quality. Now, because all
desires aim at happiness but are based on diﬀerent ideas of what happiness is and
how it’s best attained, our discernment concerning the nature of true happiness
has the potential to succeed in bringing some order and consistency into our
desires. A er all, they all have a common goal. But for your discernment to
succeed, it has to present a consistent picture of what long-term happiness is and
to present that picture in an attractive way.
e Buddha himself said his awakening depended on two qualities inherent in
a strong desire. One was discontent with whatever skills are not yet good enough
for fully reaching the goal. In other words, you’re not going to content yourself
with anything less. e second quality is an unwillingness to give up, whatever
the hardships, until you’ve reached your aim.
Now, discontent is present in all desire, but the Buddha focused his discontent
speci cally on the level of skill in his actions. As long as his actions hadn’t yet
arrived at true happiness, he would try to develop his skills even further. As for
the eﬀort he had to put in, it would require relinquishing certain things, which
meant that he also needed to develop endurance and equanimity.
e name for this kind of focused desire is determination. Determination is
an overarching desire that tries to bring some order to our other desires so that
they can work together in achieving a deeply desired goal. When we discuss the
perfection of truth, we’ll see the Buddha’s explanation for how this kind of desire
or determination becomes focused on awakening.
But in short, the explanation is this: When we meet with a person whose
actions inspire con dence, we spend time with that person, listen to that person’s
Dhamma, and contemplate it until we see that it makes sense. at person’s words


25

and example show that the Dhamma opens new possibilities in life, and points to
potentials within ourselves that we may not have suspected before. When we nd
those possibilities attractive, and realize that we have to develop those potentials,
that’s when we give rise to the desire to follow the Dhamma.
What that person will teach is that we have to face the fact of death, and to
think about what we’ll have remaining when death comes. He or she also teaches
us that it is possible to nd a path of happiness that doesn’t die.
Now, remember the four determinations that we mentioned this morning:
• not to neglect discernment,
• to guard the truth,
• to be devoted to relinquishment, and
• to train for calm.
Let’s talk about each of these four.
We’ll start with discernment. Even though all the things that we experience
begin with desire, we don’t always get the desired results. Either we follow
unskillful desires, we follow unskillful methods, or we can’t motivate ourselves to
stick with skillful desires and skillful methods when we meet with obstacles. In
order to attain a true happiness, we need discernment to help bring some order to
our desires. is will enable us to choose a wise goal, to judge the means by which
we bring that goal about, and to motivate ourselves to follow those means in spite
of obstacles. In this way, discernment has to give guidance to the remaining
determinations.
In the Buddha’s teachings, discernment has an aspect both of the head and of
the heart, and both aspects aim at long-term happiness.
e head aspect has to do with a calculation: understanding cause and eﬀect,
and guring out how to use the principles of cause and eﬀect to nd a happiness
that’s worth the eﬀort needed to attain it. When the Buddha gave his shortest
explanation of what his awakening was about, it was a statement of a principle of
cause and eﬀect. It explains how there is a pattern to cause and eﬀect, but it’s not
deterministic. ere is some freedom of choice. We’ll discuss more of this point
tomorrow evening.
As for the heart aspect of discernment, it focuses on a happiness that doesn’t
change—and so never gets disturbed—and also on a happiness that causes no
harm. ere’s a part of the mind that wants to have long-term rest. As the Buddha


26

said, there is no happiness other than peace. Now, we might want to argue with
that, pointing out the many kinds of happiness that are not very peaceful at all.
We also tend to think that happiness requires variety: goat cheese today, blue
cheese tomorrow. But this is basically because what we get in our normal
pleasures is not really satisfactory. What the heart really wants is something
where, when you get it, you don’t need anything else. We’ve been taught that such
a happiness is impossible, so we should try to satisfy ourselves with a variety of
sensual pleasures, but the beginning of real discernment in the Buddhist sense is
allowing for the possibility that, with the proper training, a totally satisfactory
and blameless happiness is possible a er all.
Now, as we bring discernment to our lives, we have to combine these two
aspects of discernment, the head and the heart. Your head has to train the heart
to be willing to admit the patterns of cause and eﬀect so that it doesn’t act only
on its impulses and so that its eﬀorts don’t go to waste in useless actions. It also
has to train the heart to realize that simply having skillful intentions is not
enough. e heart has to be resilient enough to make those intentions become
realities. is means that, for the heart to be really good, it also has to be strong.
is is re ected in the list of perfections themselves: Goodwill has to be backed
up with truth, endurance, and persistence if it’s going to be developed as a
perfection. At the same time, your heart has to train your head to use its
intelligence in looking for a happiness that’s reliable and harmless.
is is why discernment in the Buddha’s path is both a matter of right view
and right resolve. Right resolve is the determination to act for the sake of true
happiness in line with what our intelligence accepts as working hypotheses about
cause and eﬀect. “Not to neglect discernment” means to keep remembering this long-
term perspective pro ided by discernment as we make our decisions in daily life. e
big problem here is that we can o en stumble over our hungers because both our
head and our heart o en get overturned by our gut.
I’ll tell you a story. ere’s a sea creature called a sea squirt. It’s a little tiny
thing, basically a little digestive tract and a little brain. A er it’s born, it’ll ow
through the ocean in line with the sea currents. When it lands in what it thinks is
a good spot, it’ll settle down and spend the rest of its life there. And the rst thing
it does once it has found its spot is to digest its brain. It spends the rest of its life
as a mindless digestive tract.



27

A lot of human beings are like this: Our appetites consume our intelligence.
e rst duty of discernment is to not let our brain get digested by our stomach
so that it can teach the heart that our short-term pleasure can o en get in the way
of long-term happiness, and so that it can motivate both the heart and the mind
to want the long-term.
As the Buddha said, the question that lies at the beginning of discernment is
“What, when I do it, will lead to my long-term welfare and happiness?” e
wisdom here lies in seeing that our actions are needed in order to lead to
happiness, that long-term happiness is possible, and that long-term is better than
short-term.
ere’s a passage in the Dhammapada saying that if a wise person sees a long-
term happiness that comes from abandoning a short-term happiness, the wise
person will abandon the short-term for the sake of the long-term. A British
translator of the Dhammapada said that this could not possibly be the meaning
of this passage: It’s too obvious. Well, it may be obvious, but how many people
actually live this way? is is why the Buddha has to keep reminding us of this.
When I was taking the Dhamma exams in ailand, one of the exams each
year involved writing a short Dhamma talk in which you quoted a passage from
the Buddha’s teachings. ey had provided a textbook full of Dhamma passages,
and all the little novices were memorizing page a er page a er page of these
passages. Now, memorization was not my strong point—and especially not in a
language not my own—so I gured I needed a few passages I could use no matter
what the topic assigned for the Dhamma talk. is was one of the ones I chose,
and it took me through three years of Dhamma exams—which gives you an idea
of how important this principle is.
However, simply reminding yourself that long-term happiness is better than
short-term happiness is not enough. Discernment also has to make long-term
happiness attractive to motivate you to want to do the things that you don’t like
doing but will lead to long-term happiness, and to abstain from things that you
like doing but will lead to long-term harm.
Discernment, for this reason, has to be strategic. is can be seen in the
guidance that it gives to the other determinations.
For example, the determination on truth: Once you’ve set your heart and
mind on a goal, there are things you will have to do that you may not like doing.
As we will see when we discuss the perfection of truth, “truth” has many

28

meanings. But its most important meaning in relationship to determination is
being true to yourself: making it a point of honor to follow through with what
needs to be done and not letting your hungers deceive you into following desires
that are at cross purposes with developing the perfections.
e problem is that when we set awakening as a goal, it’s a truth we haven’t
seen for ourselves. We need conviction that long-term happiness is possible and
that it can be attained through our actions. is conviction requires an act of
imagination to overcome our laziness when the actions that are required by the
path seem too hard.
Now, right view gives us some working hypotheses to overcome this
ignorance. is is why it’s called right view rather than right knowledge. In other
words, you don’t really know that right view is true until you’ve gained
awakening. Still, you adopt it as a working hypothesis because you nd that it’s
reasonable and attractive, and it puts you in a position of power in your life so
that you’re not simply a victim of circumstances.
Right view is not so much a view about the true nature of things. It’s a view
about how skillful and unskillful actions can truly bring about good or bad
results.
Right resolve then builds on this understanding. It gives you attitudes to
develop about which actions and ways of thinking are in line with right view for
the sake of the best results. In this way, by following right view and right resolve
in our actions, we maintain the truth of our original determination and also the
truth of our character. is is how we “guard the truth.”
e third determination is relinquishment, and here there’s a similar
problem. ere are things that we have to abandon if we want to achieve the goal,
and the trick here is to see that relinquishment is not a deprivation. It’s a trade.
Right view and right resolve teach us that through developing the skills of giving
and renunciation, we’re trading up.
Our problem in modern society is that we all want to win at chess and yet
keep all our pieces. So, one of the lessons of determination is that you have to be
willing to give up certain things to get what you want. To be “devoted to
relinquishment” means that we keep making skillful trades willingly.
e fourth determination is calm. Right view and right resolve work together
to give us the right perspective, the long-term perspective that helps keep the



29

mind calm while we’re doing what we may not like doing and refraining from
things that we would like to do. is perspective helps us to see that we’re
accomplishing something of value. It also helps us to reassure ourselves that we
have the strength within us to keep going. It helps us to see the value of
endurance and equanimity, in that they make our goodness—and our happiness
—independent of conditions around us. It also enables us to see that the
challenges and setbacks of life are actually opportunities to develop perfections of
our character. is gives us strength in facing diﬃculties and even joy in taking on
challenges. In fact, in the Buddhist analysis of how mind states develop in
meditation, calm follows from joy. So, we try to take joy in meeting these
challenges.
At the same time, calm functions not only as part of the path to our goal. It’s
also an aspect of the goal to which we aim. We want a goal that’s truly satisfying,
one in which the mind can nd genuine rest.
So, when we keep the mind calm on the path so that we have the stamina to
pursue the path until we nd the true peace of the goal, that’s how we “train only
for calm.”
Now, you can see that in all of these cases, discernment provides the right
perspective that helps us to take the long view. is perspective also nurtures the
strengths enabling us to sustain that long-term view as we choose our actions
from day to day, in line with our determination to reach what we most desire:
unconditional happiness.
We’ll continue this discussion tomorrow night.

QUESTIONS

Q: e practice of the Dhamma sometimes seems paradoxical. We’re told to
aim high as we practice meditation, in other words to aim at awakening, but at
the same time, we’re also advised to practice the meditation as if it were a gi ,
something that we give without expecting anything in return. It’s diﬃcult to
know how to combine these instructions.
A: Aim high. Expect something in return. at’s why we’re meditating.
However, if you’re thinking only about what you’re going to get at the end of the
retreat, you’re not going to be focusing on the job at hand. ink about it this
way: You’re driving on a road that leads to a mountain and you want to reach the


30

mountain. But if you spend all your time watching the mountain, you drive oﬀ
the road. e way to reach your goal is to focus on the road. Just check your rear-
view mirror every now and then to make sure that the mountain is not behind
you.

Q: Of the ten pāramīs, it seems to me that only determination doesn’t develop
on its own. Is this the consequence of kamma?
A: None of the perfections develop on their own. ey all have to be
developed. In some cases, an individual person may have developed a lot of these
perfections in the past, but you can’t totally depend on your past actions to carry
you through. at would encourage laziness, which is an anti-perfection.
Everybody has the chance to develop all of the perfections in this lifetime. So,
work on them now.

Q: What is the diﬀerence between chanda, which can mean desire or wish,
and lobha, which can mean desire or greed?
A: Chanda can cover any kind of desire, skillful or unskillful. In fact, chanda is
part of the factor of right eﬀort and it’s also one of the bases for concentration.
ere’s a sutta where a brahman comes to see Ven. Ānanda and asks, “What is the
goal that you practice for?” And Ānanda says, “Well, one of the goals is to put an
end to desire.” And the brahman asks, “So, what is the path to the end of desire?”
Ānanda replies, “A part of it is concentration based on desire.” e brahman says,
“Now, wait a minute. at’s impossible. How can you use desire to end desire?”
Ānanda replies, “Let me question you rst. Before you came here to this
monastery, did you have a desire to come here?” “Yes.” “And now that you’re here,
do you still have that desire?” “No.” Ānanda then says, “In the same way, you use
desire to motivate yourself to act in a way that leads you to the point where you
don’t need the desire anymore.”
As for lobha, that’s greed, basically greed for things or relationships. e
Buddha says that this is unskillful if it goes beyond the bounds of propriety. It is
possible to have greed for things within reason, but it becomes unskillful if you
have to steal or lie or do something unskillful in order to get that thing.

Q: What, for you, is happiness? e response will help to rectify my tendency
to think of happiness as the MacGuﬃn of Buddhism. MacGuﬃn is a concept


31

developed by Alfred Hitchcock to characterize the motor of the action in a lm
without one being made aware of what that motor or what that action is.
A: We talk about happiness but we never de ne it. e Buddha himself never
de ned happiness. And I think there’s a good reason for that. He talks about
training the mind to get rid of suﬀering and to nd true happiness, but he never
de nes “mind,” he never de nes “suﬀering,” and he never de nes “happiness.” All
he de nes is the training, and he does that in lots of detail. is is because as you
follow the training, your concepts of mind, suﬀering, and happiness are going to
develop.
To focus on happiness: In the beginning, you’re aware simply of the happiness
of sensual pleasures. When you see the stress in that pleasure and the drawbacks it
entails, you try to develop the happiness of concentration. As this happiness
makes you more sensitive to subtler levels of suﬀering and stress, you begin to
detect the stress even in the happiness of concentration itself, so you look for
what’s better than that, something less stressful. at would be the happiness of
nibbāna, the happiness of a mind with no limits at all. It’s totally free and totally
peaceful. Unbound. at’s the happiness for which we’re practicing.

DAY THREE
MORNING

Pain
e topic this morning is pain. Pain is not one of the perfections. It is,
however, a problem that everybody in the room is experiencing. If you
understand how to deal with your pains, it’ll be easier to understand the Buddha’s
teachings on discernment and right view. at’s because the teachings on right
view deal speci cally with how we create unnecessary suﬀering around pain, and
how—if we can learn how to avoid fabricating ignorant thoughts and perceptions
around pain—it’ll cause no suﬀering in the mind.
e rst thing that you have to understand about pain is that some of it comes
from your actions in the past—such as the way you’ve been using your body, the
way you’ve been feeding it, the extent to which you have or haven’t been
exercising it—but some of the causes for the pain are things you’re doing right
now. ese are things you can change, and in some cases changing what you’re
doing can make the pain go away. But even if you can’t make the pain go away,
there’s the question of the extent to which you have to suﬀer from the pain even
when it’s present. Because what we’re aiming at is a state of mind that can be
present to the inevitable facts of aging, illness, and death and yet still not suﬀer.
So, the rst line of business right now as we meditate is to learn how not to suﬀer
around pain.
e ways to deal with pain are directly related to the Buddha’s instructions on
how to use the breath as a topic for understanding feelings. ere are four steps
altogether.
e rst step is to breathe in and out sensitive to rapture—and here the word
“rapture,” pīti, can also mean fullness or refreshment.
e second step is to breathe in and out sensitive to pleasure or ease.
e third is to breathe in and out sensitive to mental fabrication, which means
feelings and perceptions. e feelings here are feeling tones of pleasure, pain, or
neither pain nor pleasure. Perceptions are the images or words you hold in mind



33

by which you identify and label things. So, as I said, the third step is to be
sensitive to these processes of mental fabrication.
e fourth step is to breathe in and out calming these mental fabrications.
Now, of the various forest ajaans, Ajaan Lee gives the most detailed
instructions on the rst two steps, and Ajaan Maha Boowa gives the most
detailed instructions on the last two. Let’s look at what they have to say.
With regard to breathing in and out sensitive to rapture, Ajaan Lee
recommends, when there are pains in the body, not to focus on the pains
immediately. Focus instead on the parts of the body that you can make
comfortable and refreshing with the breath.
As you try to give rise to feelings of rapture, it’s good to think of the diﬀerent
meanings of the Pāli term for rapture, pīti. When we translate it as “rapture,” it
sounds like we’re trying to experience ecstasies, like Saint eresa. In some cases,
it actually can be that strong, but the term pīti can also mean refreshment or a
sense of fullness, and for most people, that’s how we rst experience this quality.
So, how do you breathe in and out sensitive to refreshment or fullness? One
quick exercise is to nd a spot in the body that’s especially sensitive—it might be
the back of the hands, right at the diaphragm, or in the middle of the chest—and
pay attention to that spot very carefully as you breathe in and breathe out. If
there’s any sense of tension at all in that spot, disperse the tension. If you feel like
you’re squeezing the breath out as you breathe out at that spot, stop the sensation
of squeezing so that that spot can stay full even as you’re breathing out. If there’s
any sense of pinching the breath or tensing up between the in-breath and the out-
breath, allow the breath to dissolve that sense of pinching or tensing.
As you get so that you can maintain this sense of fullness while you breathe in
and breathe out, and it feels pleasant, you can then think of the fullness and the
pleasure spreading to the diﬀerent parts of the body. You spread those feelings
together with the breath energy. Now, we’ve already had some questions about
what this breath energy is and how you sense it. Try another quick exercise. Hold
your hand out in front of your body and keep your eyes closed. e sensations
that let you know your hand is there: ose are breath sensations.
Now, sometimes as you breathe in and breathe out, there will be a sense of
movement in the breath energy in diﬀerent parts of the body. Other times, it will
be still, but either way, it’s an energy. Hold that perception in mind. at’s the



34

perception you’ll use in order to spread the breath energy, together with the
fullness and pleasure, throughout the body.
ere are diﬀerent perceptions you can hold in mind to help you feel the sense
of the breath energy moving. For instance, you can think of the body as being like
a sponge: As you breathe in and out, the breath comes in and out through all the
pores of the sponge. Another perception is that there’s a column of energy going
down the middle of the body, and as you breathe in, energy comes in from the
outside and goes into the column of energy, and as you breathe out, it goes out of
the body in all directions from that column of energy. As you hold in mind the
possibility that breath energy can do this, you will begin to sense that, yes, there is
a movement.
Even though you use images to induce this sensitivity, that doesn’t mean that
the energy is imaginary. It’s like telling a child that the world is round. As far as
the child is concerned, the world doesn’t look round, so he has to imagine it as
round. But as the child grows up, he begins to realize that, yes, the world is round.
If you’re going to y the quickest route from, say, Paris to Los Angeles, you have
to y over Greenland. If the world were at, that wouldn’t work. But because the
world is round, that’s the way you have to y to save time. In the same way, you
use your imagination to allow yourself to think that the breath energy does ow,
and then as you get more and more sensitive to the body, you begin to realize that
it actually does.
As you spread the comfortable sense of fullness along with the breath energy,
you may run into pains. As I said, Ajaan Lee recommends that you not focus
directly on the pain quite yet. Instead, keep your focus on the parts of the body
where you can make the breath energy comfortable. is way, you give the mind a
good foundation or a safe place to stay.
en, when you feel secure in that good breath energy—accompanied by a
sense of pleasure and fullness—the next step is to think of the energy radiating
from the comfortable spot and going through the pain.
For instance, suppose you have a pain in your knee. Ajaan Lee recommends
imagining the breath energy going down the leg and not stopping at the knee, but
going through the knee and out the foot. If you think of the energy stopping
right at the pain, that’ll reinforce the sense of tension around the pain, which is
part of the problem. Maybe, when we were children, we sensed the breath energy
moving through the body, and we were afraid that if it went through the pain it


35

would spread the pain, so we subconsciously tensed up around the pain to stop it.
But that actually makes the pain worse. So, to repeat, if there’s a pain in the knee,
think of the breath energy going through the pain in the knee and then out the
foot.
In some cases, you’ll nd that the pain will actually go away. at’s a sign that
the pain was caused by something you’re doing right now. In other cases, though,
the pain will still be there, which is a sign that the pain is caused by something
that you did before you sat here or simply by the fact that your body is not yet
used to this posture. If you’re new to the meditation posture, there will inevitably
be a period in which there’s pain in the legs as the blood is being blocked or being
squeezed out of the part where the legs are folded. is forces the blood out of
the main arteries into the capillaries. It’s as if there were a traﬃc jam on a main
road, and the traﬃc has to go down through the small streets, where it gets even
more jammed.
e diﬀerence with your body, though, is that if you keep forcing the blood
through those capillaries by sitting in this posture again and again, the capillaries
will eventually begin to expand. In other words, you’re turning them into new
arteries. Streets can’t do this, but blood vessels can. If you have some patience
with these kinds of pain, eventually they will go away over time as your body gets
more adapted to the meditation posture.
You’ll notice that a large factor in making use of feelings of rapture and
pleasure lies in the perceptions you bring to them, such as the image of the sponge
or the column of energy, or of the energy being able to ow in diﬀerent places
and diﬀerent directions. e same principle applies to feelings of pain. Your
perceptions of pain play a huge role in the impact it has on the mind.
is brings us to the third and fourth steps in the tetrad, getting sensitive to
mental fabrication and calming it. To sensitize yourself to how perceptions of
pain may be aﬀecting your mind, Ajaan Maha Boowa recommends that you ask
questions about how you perceive the pain. For example, he says, suppose there’s a
pain in your hip: Is the pain the same thing as the hip? Or are there two diﬀerent
kinds of sensations in the same place? In other words, the sensation of the body is
one thing and the sensation of the pain is something else. Now, your rational
mind knows that these are two separate things, but all too o en in our direct
experience of the pain, something in the mind says that the pain and the body



36

have become one and the same thing. e pain has invaded the body, and you’re
trying to push it out.
So here, to calm the perception, you have to change it. e body and the pain
are two separate things even though they’re in the same spot. e sensations of
the body are the four elementary physical properties of earth (solidity), water
(liquidity), re (warmth), and wind (energy), but the sensation of pain is none of
these things. It’s as if it’s on a diﬀerent frequency. We can make a comparison with
radio waves going through the air. You put a radio in one spot, you adjust the dial
to one frequency, and you get one station. If you adjust it to another frequency,
there’s another station. You don’t have to move the radio to a diﬀerent spot to get
a diﬀerent station, because the waves are all in the same place, and yet you can
separate them out because their frequencies are diﬀerent, and you’ve got
something that can detect the diﬀerence. See if you can do the same thing with
the sensations of the pain and sensations of the body in that one spot.
Another perception that might be playing a role in your experience of pain
comes from the notion that we have to be responsible for our pains. In other
words, right now you think you’ve got to warn the next moment in the future
that there’s a pain right here. To correct that tendency, tell yourself, “I don’t have
to tell the future. e future will nd out on its own.” Otherwise, you use
perceptions to keep sending a message from one moment to the next to the next,
which stitches the pains together, adding to the pain and suﬀering.
A similar problem is when you’re sitting with some pain and you keep telling
yourself, “I’ve been sitting with this pain for the past 15 minutes and the session’s
going to last for another 25 minutes.” at’s 40 minutes of pain placed on top of
one moment, and then, of course, the present moment will break down.
And here Ajaan Lee has a good image for problems of this sort: You’re
plowing a eld, and next to the plow you’ve attached a big bag. As the dirt falls oﬀ
the plow, you put it in the bag. Of course, you’re going to get weighed down. So,
simply get rid of the bag and let the pain fall oﬀ at the rst moment. You don’t
have to feel responsible for it; you don’t have to keep a record of it. Just stay with
the sensation in the present moment.
Ajaan Maha Boowa notes that you can also ask yourself if the pain has a bad
intention toward you. Your rational mind knows that the pain itself has no
awareness, so it can’t have any intention to hurt you at all, but that perception
may be lying around in your mind, the result of something you may have assumed


37

about pain when you were a child, and it can still have an eﬀect. So, try to bring it
up into your conscious awareness by asking this question: “Does the pain mean to
hurt me?” en reason with any part of the mind that says, “Yes.”
Another series of questions you can ask about your perception of pain is this:
“Is the pain one solid thing? Does it have a shape in your imagination or is it
simply diﬀerent moments of pain arising and passing way?” If you look very
carefully, you see that it is made up of individual moments. So, try to drop the
perception that the pain is solid or has a shape.
en you look at those moments of pain and ask yourself: “As they appear, are
they coming at me or are they going away?” If you have the perception they’re
coming at you, that will make you suﬀer more from the pain. But if you can hold
in mind the perception that as soon as they appear they’re going away, you’ll
suﬀer a lot less.
Once, when I was in Singapore, I was taken to see a Chinese doctor to treat
my back. He had me lie down on my stomach, and then he rubbed some oil in my
back, at rst gently, but then more and more roughly. en he took out two
bamboo sections that had been cut so that they were like whisks, and then he
started beating on my back. My rst thought was, “What bad kamma did I do to
deserve this?” But because I couldn’t speak Chinese, I couldn’t ask him how
much longer the treatment was going to last. So, I told myself I’d have to change
my perceptions around the pain. I realized that if I could see the pains, as soon as
they appeared, as going away from me instead of coming at me, I suﬀered a lot
less. It’s like sitting on a truck facing backwards. As you go down the road, as soon
as anything appears in your range of vision, it’s already going away from you. is
perception can help make you suﬀer a lot less from the pain.
Another question Ajaan Maha Boowa recommends asking is, “Where is the
sharpest point of the pain?” en try to track it down. Or ask yourself, as you
breathe in, “Which direction is the breath coming from as it goes through the
pain? Can I switch the directions?” See what that does. e important thing,
though, is that you show that you’re not afraid of the pain. You’ll nd that even if
you don’t change the direction of the breath, the spot of the most intense part of
the pain keeps shi ing around. is teaches you two lessons. One is that the pain
is not as solid as you thought it was. e second is that as long as you keep at the
questions about how you perceive the pain, the mind becomes a moving target.
When you’re a moving target, it’s harder for the pain to hit you. If you just sit


38

there and suﬀer from the pain, complaining to yourself about it, then you’re an
easy target to hit. But if you make it your purpose to understand the pain, then
you’re going to suﬀer a lot less from it.
is is precisely what the Buddha has you do. He says your duty with regard to
pain is not just to endure it, and it’s not to make it go away. e duty is to
comprehend it. You comprehend it by asking questions and being curious about
it.
is requires that you be fearless of the pain, which requires in turn that you
have a good foundation inside. is is why we rst work to make the breath
comfortable so that when the pain gets too intense for us, we know we have a
comfortable place to retreat to. But as the Buddha said, if you really comprehend
the suﬀering that you create around the pain, then you’ll nd that you can locate
the cause of suﬀering and abandon the cause. And the cause will be in the mind:
right around the perceptions you have around the pain. When you nd the
mental act that causes the mind to suﬀer around the pain, you can drop it. at
way, even though the pain may still be there, you don’t have to suﬀer from it.
at’s the duty with regard to right view.
Ajaan Fuang told me a story about when he was a young monk. He was
suﬀering from severe headaches that went on for months at a time. He tried
Chinese medicine, Western medicine, ai medicine: Nothing worked.
Sometimes the headaches were so bad that younger monks arranged to stay with
him at night to help look a er him. One night, he woke up in the middle of the
night. He sat up, and all the other monks were fast asleep. His rst thought was,
“Who’s looking a er whom here?” But he thought, “Well, I’m not going to get
any help from them.” So, he decided to meditate and he realized he had been
trying to get rid of the headache, when the duty with regard to pain is to try to
comprehend it. He focused on comprehending it and, as he told me, he got some
of the most important insights in his meditation.
One of the insights you gain by trying to comprehend pain in this way is
seeing the extent to which you’re making choices in the present moment that you
normally are not aware of. In other words, the present moment is not simply
given to you from the past. You’re also shaping it in the present moment as well.
You come to see that if you shape it with ignorance, it’s going to cause suﬀering. If
you shape it with knowledge, it becomes part of the path to the end of suﬀering.
We suﬀer not because of our past kamma but because of our present kamma:


39

what we’re doing right now. If you can see your present kamma clearly, you can
get rid of the suﬀering with which you’re weighing your own mind down. And
that’s the only suﬀering that places a weight on the mind.
One day, when a group of us were sitting at the monastery in California,
Ajaan Suwat—my other teacher—pointed to the mountain across the valley and
asked, “ at mountain: Is it heavy?” Now you know, when an ajaan asks a
question like this, it’s a trick question. So, nobody answered. He nally said,
“Only if you try to pick it up is it going to be heavy. If you don’t try to pick it up,
it may be heavy in and of itself, but it’s not heavy on you, and that’s all that
matters.” In the same way, the suﬀering that we cause in the present moment is
like picking up the mountain. If you stop creating that suﬀering, the other pains
and disappointments in the world will not impinge on the mind. ey may be
heavy in and of themselves, but they’re not heavy on you. And that’s all you’re
responsible for.
So, it’s important that you not be afraid of pain. But if you’re just getting
started in meditation, don’t overdo your endurance. Don’t try to force your
endurance too much. If the pain is so intense that you can’t focus on the breath,
then very mindfully change your position. But if you nd that you can stay with
the breath in spite of the pain, then use the breath to create that foundation you
need in order to understand the pain. And maybe you’ll gain some important
insights of your own.

QUESTIONS

Q: In your instructions for meditation you advise us to imagine that we can
breathe from the top of the head. I recoil greatly from this type of image. It’s a
suggestion, isn’t it? Isn’t it an illusion? A er all, when you meditate, don’t you see
reality face-to-face? ank you for your response.
A: O en, before you see something, you have to imagine that it’s possible. e
reason I have you imagine these things is related to the fact that the way you
perceive your body will have an impact on what you can actually do with your
body. If you feel that there is no possibility that energy can ow in your head,
then you will feel that there is nothing that you can do with the energy in your
head. When I tell you that you can imagine that the energy can ow through the
head, this opens up the possibility of doing something with that energy that’s


40

already there. I say this just to open your mind to the possibility of something
that is already there, so that you can do something skillful with the energy.
You can make a comparison with the ozone hole over Antarctica. For years,
satellites were sending information about the ozone hole, but the computer
program that analyzed the data threw out the information coming from the
satellites, because the people who wrote the program couldn’t imagine that an
ozone hole was possible. Only when they allowed themselves to imagine it could
they accept the data.

Q: Could you say a little bit more about the topic of rapture?
A: e word rapture in Pāli, pīti, can mean refreshment and can also mean
fullness. Some people experience it as a sense of intense satisfaction, just being in
the present moment and not wanting anything else. In some cases, it’ll have some
very strong manifestations. Some people nd that their body starts moving. Some
people feel that energy is owing over the body in waves. Other people
experience it in a much gentler form.
As you’re meditating, if you nd that it’s getting too intense, nd a spot in the
body where the energy is milder and focus your attention there. en let the sense
of fullness go away. You might think of allowing it to spread out in all directions,
with nothing to contain it. You might think of it going out the palms of your
hands or the soles of your feet. It is a sign that the mind is settling down, but if
you want to let your concentration get stronger, you have to get past that to a
state of deep calm.

Q: On my very rst retreat, on the second day I had a very strong experience
of pīti, or rapture. In subsequent retreats it has gotten weaker, as has my
concentration. I know I shouldn’t have expectations and I thought that I didn’t,
but now I wonder if I’m doing something wrong in my meditation.
A: e intensity of the pīti is not a measure of your concentration. It’s like
drinking a glass of water. If you’ve been walking across a desert for three days and
you drink a glass of water, the intensity of the experience will be very strong. But
if you’ve been drinking water every day and you drink another glass of water, it’s
not that intense. So, maybe your body doesn’t need the pīti so much now. e
important thing is not to measure your concentration by the pīti. Otherwise, you



41

may tend to underestimate your concentration and then you throw it away, and
so it won’t have an opportunity to develop.
When I was a young meditator, I thought a good meditation required having
visions. I wasn’t having any visions, so I didn’t think I had any concentration. As a
result, I didn’t nurture what concentration I had. I kept looking for something
else. But once I realized that visions were not necessary, I learned to appreciate
the concentration I had. When you appreciate it, you tend to it, and it has an
opportunity to develop.

Q: Sometimes during meditation, my body seems to move on its own, in a
circling movement. Is it normal? What should I do? ank you.
A: is is a manifestation of rapture, and it is normal. When it happens, don’t
encourage it, but don’t discourage it, either. Stay focused on your breath. e
movement will give more energy to the body as needed and then it should stop
on its own.

Q: I’ve been told that in vipassanā meditation, we should observe every
sensation that occurs in the body and not control anything. If I’m controlling the
rhythm of breathing in diﬀerent parts of the body, isn’t that the opposite of what
vipassanā meditation tells me to do? Could you say something about the
sensation of electrical discharge in the body? ank you.
A: ere are two questions here. e easier one is the electrical discharge. As
you open up the breath channels in the body, every now and then, when a
blockage gets opened up, there will be a sense of an electric discharge. at’s
nothing to be worried about.
Now about vipassanā: e object of vipassanā is to gain dispassion toward the
fabrications with which we shape the present moment. ere are two diﬀerent
ways of approaching vipassanā. One is just to try not to fabricate anything in the
present moment. e other is to very consciously fabricate the present moment so
that you can see the extent to which the present moment is fabricated, and the
limitations on how far you can create pleasure and happiness through your
fabrications.
In my experience, the problem with the rst approach is that when you tell
yourself not to control the present moment, a lot of the fabrication goes
underground where you deny its existence. Also, when something really


42

disturbing comes up in the present moment, you have no tools for alleviating it.
We’re taking the second approach here because it does make you more sensitive to
what you’re doing and it teaches you skills that you can use when something really
disturbing does occur. If you look at the Buddha’s instructions on breath
meditation—which are instructions on how to develop tranquility and vipassanā
together—you’ll nd that they involve consciously fabricating the breath in many
diﬀerent ways.

EVENING

Discernment
Tonight’s talk is on the perfection of discernment. For the Buddha,
discernment starts when we honor our desire for true happiness. is means that
discernment starts when we have genuine goodwill for ourselves. So, in tonight’s
discussion, I want you to keep in mind that when we discuss right view, the right
response to right view has to be motivated by goodwill.
Right view has two main levels—mundane and transcendent—and with each
level of right view I will keep referring to the question: If you have goodwill for
yourself, how would you best respond to what right view tells you on this level?
e inclusion of goodwill in the discussion of discernment here follows the fact
that the discernment factors of the noble eightfold path include not only right
view, but also right resolve. And goodwill is one of the ways in which right resolve
is expressed.
e role of goodwill in discernment starts with the questions that the Buddha
says lie at the beginning of discernment: “What, when I do it, will lead to my
long-term welfare and happiness? What, when I do it, will lead to long-term
harm and suﬀering?” e discernment or wisdom here lies in realizing (1) there is
such a thing as long-term happiness, (2) it’s better than short-term, and (3)
happiness comes from our actions, so we have to understand the pattern by which
actions lead to results. ese questions provide the context for right view both on
its mundane and on its transcendent levels. Right view on both levels gives
further guidance to our desires for true happiness.




43

Notice that right view here deals with the nature of actions and not the nature
of things. Sometimes we hear that we’re attached, say, to this clock because we
think it has an inherent essence. Actually, though, we’re attached to it because we
think that holding on to it will give us pleasure, and that it’s worth the eﬀort to
hold on to it—even if we know full well that it has no inherent essence. If we
gure that it doesn’t give us any pleasure anymore, or that it’s not worth the
eﬀort, we throw it away, even if we think that it does have inherent essence. e
issue then comes down not so much to the nature of things outside, but to the
question of which actions we think are worth doing.
On the level of mundane right view, the two big issues are kamma and
rebirth.
e lesson that comes from the Buddha’s teachings on kamma is that your
actions come from your intentions, your intentions come from your mind, so
your mind is the factor that shapes your life. is in uence can come from the
mind’s actions in the past or from its actions in the present moment or from the
two combined. e mind is not just a by-product of physical processes. e mind
is in charge. It is proactive and purposeful. In other words, it doesn’t simply
respond to stimuli. It actually goes out looking for happiness. What we learn
from mundane right view is which actions are skillful, actually leading to
happiness, and which are unskillful, leading to suﬀering. If you bring goodwill to
this knowledge, you have to remind yourself that if you desire true happiness, you
have to develop honorable qualities of the mind that are harmless. e task of
developing these honorable qualities is thus something eminently worth doing.
ose are the lessons from the teaching on kamma.
e lessons from the teaching on rebirth are that consciousness as a process
can survive the death of the body, and that the results of your actions can
in uence what you will experience in your future rebirths. is fact must be taken
into consideration when you plan a course of action as to what’s worth doing.
Some people say, “I don’t want to hear about future rebirths. I want to focus only
on what I’m doing right now in my daily life.” In fact, though, you can’t separate
the two issues. e decisions you’re making in your daily life will have an impact
on your future lives, and this fact has to be taken into consideration when you’re
trying to decide what’s worth doing right now.
Now, there are many things that will have to be abandoned at death, but
certain qualities that are developed in the mind, whether good or bad, can carry


44

over to future lives. If you bring goodwill to this knowledge, you realize that your
life will be well spent if you devote it to developing the good qualities in your
heart and mind that will carry over to the future.
ere’s a story that relates to my family life. When I was a teenager, my family
built a house. We hired an architect and played a large role in designing the
house. My father was a carpenter, so he did some of the physical work on the
house, too. He was very proud of the house. Several years later, we had to move,
so we sold the house. en, many years a er that, my father said one day, “Let’s go
see the old house.” We discovered that the new owners had changed a lot of the
details and didn’t seem to be taking good care of the house. My father was not
pleased.
As we were driving back home, he said, “You know, I have nothing to point to
as an accomplishment in my life.” When I was young, he was a farmer, growing
potatoes, and the government came and said, “You have to throw your potatoes
away, otherwise the price of potatoes will fall too low.” A er two years of this, we
had to sell the farm. My father became a government worker, and he worked his
way up the bureaucratic ladder until he was on the National Water Resources
Council, which did a lot of work on water conservation. en, Reagan became
president and abolished the Water Resources Council, so my father took early
retirement. A er telling me all this again that a ernoon, he concluded by saying
that he had nothing to show for in his life.
I had two thoughts on hearing his story. One was, “Don’t I count for
something?” e second thought was a re ection: If you try to make the meaning
of your life dependent on things outside, it’s going to lead to disappointment
because so many things outside are beyond your control. But if you can devote
your life to developing good qualities of the mind, no one else can take those
away from you. ey’ll be yours for a long time to come. Your eﬀorts in this area
are never wasted, so those qualities are clearly worth the eﬀort that goes into
developing them. ey are accomplishments that can give solid meaning to life.
at’s a lesson of mundane right view.
Transcendent right view gives further lessons as to what’s worth doing and
what’s not. Transcendent right view is expressed in the four noble truths.
Let’s look at each of the truths one by one.




45

e rst noble truth is that suﬀering is something we do. It doesn’t simply
happen to us: We cling. Now, the word “to cling” in Pāli also means to feed. We
suﬀer because of our feeding habits. Of course, “feeding” here doesn’t refer just to
physical feeding; it also refers to mental and emotional feeding. In fact, our
mental and emotional feeding are our most direct form of suﬀering, but any
feeding habit is going to involve suﬀering.
is means that suﬀering is an active, not a passive, verb. We’re not just victims
on the receiving end of suﬀering. We’re actually out there creating our suﬀering. If
we had goodwill for ourselves, we would try to end this clinging. And in order to
do that, we have to comprehend it. We have to understand how we go out and
hold on to things, how we keep clinging to things, and why.
e lesson from the second noble truth is that the suﬀering comes from
unskillful desires rather than from events or conditions outside. In other words,
things outside can be pretty bad, but there’s no need for us to suﬀer from them. If
you had goodwill for yourself, you would learn how to abandon your unskillful
desires. is includes your craving for sensuality, which, as we’ve already
explained, is your fascination with planning and fantasizing about sensual
pleasures. is is why renunciation is one of the perfections.
e third noble truth is that a total end of suﬀering is possible through
abandoning the cause. ere is a state of mind that does not have to feed because
it is totally independent, free from conditions. In the Buddha’s terminology, it’s
“unfabricated.” And it’s true happiness, the ultimate happiness. Now this, of
course, sets the bar for happiness very high. It presents a challenge. Basically, the
Buddha asks: Are we going to content ourselves with sensual pleasures? Are we
going to accept the messages of advertisers? ey say that we’re going to be happy
if we buy their product, and they’ve learned how to use our own desires against
us.
Do you know the so drink called Sprite? Did they have the Sprite
commercial here that said, “Obey your thirst”? Are you going to content yourself
with what your thirst orders you to do? Or are you going to honor your desire for
true happiness? ese questions require that we expand our imagination to
include true happiness as a possibility. If you have goodwill for yourself, you’ll
decide not to rest until you’ve realized that happiness for yourself.
e fourth noble truth is the path of practice, which involves virtue,
concentration, and discernment—which, you will notice, are three of the


46

perfections, if we count concentration as coming under renunciation. If you have
goodwill for yourself, you’re going to develop these factors, which will require
truth, endurance, persistence, and equanimity. is is why these are perfections as
well.
Now, to develop the path requires a certain kind of passion, a passion for the
practice. It requires a certain provisional clinging: You have to hold on to the
practice for it to work. at type of clinging will be a necessary part of the
practice. e Buddha gives the image of a ra . As you’re crossing the river, you
have to hold on to the ra to get to the other side. When you get to the other
side, then you can let go of the ra . Everybody likes to focus on letting go of the
ra on the other side, and sometimes people like to make a show of letting go
before they get there. But that doesn’t work. You have to bind together the ra
from whatever is available to you, and then you hold on to it until it’s gotten you
to safety.
e role of passion in motivating a path that will lead to the end of passion
means that the path has to be a strategic one. And because some clinging is
involved in developing the path, there will be some suﬀering in the practice.
Anyone who has sat for an hour will know that mastering concentration involves
some physical pain and mental discomfort. But this is suﬀering with a purpose,
unlike the suﬀering caused by unskillful actions. is means that although we’re
pursuing an unfabricated goal, we have to use fabrications to get there, because
you can’t use nibbāna to attain nibbāna. is may be one of the reasons that the
Buddha uses the image of a ra —something pieced together from branches and
twigs on this side of the river—rather than of a nibbāna yacht coming to take you
across the river. We don’t have to wait for a magical boat made of jewel-bearing
trees that will take us eﬀortlessly across the river—because there is no such boat.
We have to fabricate the path from what we’ve got.
And notice that each of these four noble truths entails a duty: to comprehend
suﬀering, to abandon the cause of suﬀering, to realize the cessation of suﬀering,
and to develop the path. is is why right resolve is part of discernment, because
you need resolve to perform and ful ll those duties. e Buddha doesn’t force
these duties on you, but if you have goodwill for yourself, you’ll take them on of
your own accord.
Notice also the role of cause and eﬀect on both levels of right view. Suﬀering
has a cause; the path to the end of suﬀering will lead to the end of suﬀering. e


47

cause of suﬀering now is the same as it was when the Buddha was teaching; the
path to the end of suﬀering is also the same. is means that the consequences of
your search for happiness are determined by patterns of cause and eﬀect that are
constant. You can’t simply say, “I like my path better than the Buddha’s path, so
I’ll follow the path I prefer.” Or rather, you can say that, but there is no guarantee
that your path will get the same results as the Buddha’s. When we say that his
path is a noble path, one of the meanings is that it applies to everyone. If
something’s required by a noble path, and you have goodwill for yourself, you
have to do it.
e Buddha gives an example of trying to get milk out of a cow. If you try
twisting the horn, you’re not going to get any milk. You can try twisting more and
more energetically, but you still don’t get any milk, and the cow will probably
kick you. Now, you may decide, “Okay, I should stop doing this,” and when you
do, you may come to the conclusion, “Hey, not putting in any eﬀort is much nicer
than making an eﬀort.” But you still don’t get the milk. e more useful course of
action is to nd the right part of the cow to pull on. You test a few diﬀerent
places, and you nally nd that when you pull on the udder, you get the milk.
In the same way, the Buddha said that if you adopt the wrong path, no matter
how much eﬀort you put into it, you’re not going to get the results. is is why
the diﬀerent factors of the path are called right: ey actually give results, and the
relationship to the path and its results is always consistent.
However, even though the pattern of cause and eﬀect is always the same, it
does provide some room for choice in the present moment. at’s actually part of
the pattern: e present moment is not totally determined by the past. Your past
actions provide you with the raw materials for fashioning the present moment
and then, through your present intentions, you turn that raw material into your
actual experience of the present moment. Your present intentions may o en be
conditioned by your past actions, but they don’t have to be. With every present
moment, you are free to make a skillful choice. is is why, when we meditate, we
focus on the present moment to see exactly how we’re fashioning the present
moment from the raw material of our past actions. We’re not sitting in the
present moment simply to enjoy the present moment. We’re trying to understand
how we’re putting it together in an unskillful way, and how we can learn to do it
more skillfully.



48

is is where the Buddha’s teachings on fabrication come in. He says there are
three kinds: bodily fabrication, verbal fabrication, and mental fabrication. Bodily
fabrication is the way you breathe. Verbal fabrication is how you talk to yourself,
and then mental fabrication corresponds to feelings and perceptions.
When you’re practicing concentration, you’re engaging in all three of these
fabrications: (1) e in-and-out breath is what you’re focusing on. (2) You talk to
yourself about how you can bring the mind to the breath, how to make the breath
more comfortable, and how to spread and maintain that sense of comfort
throughout the body. (3) To maintain and spread those feelings of pleasure, you
need a certain perception of the breath to help keep the mind focused on it and
to aid in getting the best use out of the pleasure.
As you develop the concentration using these three kinds of fabrication, you
become more sensitive as to how you’re engaging in them in the rest of your life as
well. For example, when you’re angry, you breathe in a certain uncomfortable way,
you tend to talk to yourself in ways that aggravate the anger, and you also have a
perception in mind that the person you’re angry at is a monster or a fool. Now, if
you want to continue the anger, you continue with those kinds of fabrications.
But if you have goodwill for yourself and you want to get beyond the anger, you
have to change them—and you can.
At the same time, you nd that if you want to develop the perfections, you’ll
have to fabricate them as well. For this reason, we’ll be talking about the role of
these three fabrications as we continue our discussion of each of the perfections.
Now, the question sometimes comes up: Is the search for long-term happiness
a sel sh use of your discernment? And the answer is No. ere are four reasons
for that answer.
e rst is that long-term happiness requires you to develop qualities of
goodwill, compassion, generosity, and harmlessness. No stingy or abusive person
has ever gotten to nibbāna.
e second reason is that if we go through life dissatis ed with our happiness,
we tend to get frustrated and to take our frustration out on other people. At the
monastery, we have a lot of hummingbirds. Hummingbirds feed oﬀ of nectar,
usually the nectar from owers, but they’ll also feed oﬀ of a mixture of sugar,
water, and a pinch of salt. If we ll a feeder with sugar water, the hummingbirds
will come to feed. We’ve been feeding them for many years. We have four large
feeders, and most of the time we keep the feeders full. Every now and then,

49

though, we forget. e feeders go empty, yet when the feeders are empty, the
hummingbirds don’t attack us. ey attack one another, as if to say, “You’re the
reason why there’s no more nectar.”
As I watch the hummingbirds, I think of human beings. When things get bad,
people attack one another, whether those other people are the real cause of the
problem or not. If you can nd a satisfactory happiness, and especially one that
doesn’t require feeding, you’ll have no reason to attack anyone.
e third reason why the search for true happiness isn’t sel sh is that we suﬀer
because we cling and feed on things. As long as this feeding isn’t addressed, it’s
going to taint all of our eﬀorts to be unsel sh. Years back, I heard a famous
Dhamma teacher say that he didn’t want to live in a world where no one was
suﬀering because he’d have no opportunity to be compassionate. ink about
that for a minute. You need other people to suﬀer in order for you to be happy? It
sounds unsel sh on the surface, but it’s not. at’s the third reason.
e fourth reason is that you can’t be responsible for other people’s actions. In
other words, you can’t go through life making other people happy, because their
happiness will depend on what they do. So, you focus on where you are
responsible, on your own actions, and in that way, you give a good example to
others. If they’re willing to follow the example, that’s how they become happy.
When we think about the fact that discernment is a skillful strategy, we realize
that we need some guidance from others on how to act strategically to achieve
the desired goal. At the same time, we have to develop our own powers of
perception to see these things for ourselves. is is why the Buddha says there are
three levels of discernment:
• the discernment that comes from listening or reading,
• the discernment that comes from thinking, and
• the discernment that comes from developing qualities in your mind.
Ajaan Lee gives a good analogy for how these three levels interact. Say you
want to learn how to weave a basket. e teacher can teach you how to weave, but
the teacher can’t make your basket good. You have to follow the teacher’s
instructions, but that won’t be enough to make a beautiful basket. You also have
to look at your own work: how you weave the basket, and the basket that results.
If the basket doesn’t look good, you have to think about what you can do to
improve it. You keep observing and analyzing your actions and their results, and


50

thinking about ways of improving your actions. Ultimately, the discernment
becomes yours as you learn through practice how to develop skill in your own
actions and how to consistently make beautiful baskets.
So, as I said last night, your discernment will give you some guidance as you
develop the other perfections. But at the same time, as you develop the
perfections, your discernment will become deeper and more profound. at way,
what began as the Buddha’s discernment actually becomes yours.

QUESTIONS

Q: What exactly is dual thinking and how can one bene t from it?
A: Dual thinking is when you see the diﬀerences between two things, and you
can pass judgment as to which one is better than the other. Now, some people
think that dualistic thinking is bad, but there are a lot of areas in life where dual
thinking is necessary. When you see that suﬀering is diﬀerent from not suﬀering,
the question is, “How do I stop suﬀering?” To do that, you have to begin seeing
the diﬀerence between cause and eﬀect, along with the diﬀerence between what’s
skillful and what’s unskillful. at kind of dual thinking is very useful.

Q: e Buddha told us not to believe in things without verifying them for
ourselves. We can see the results of our actions in this life, but as for the results of
our actions in future lives, how can we believe them when we can’t verify them?
A: In this case, the Buddha would advise you to use what is called a pragmatic
proof, which is that if you didn’t believe in the results of your kamma in future
lives, how would you tend to act? If you did believe in the results of your kamma
in future lives, how would you tend to act? Which belief would give rise to better
actions?
In America, they have clubs that get together on the theme: Suppose that you
only had one more year to live, how would you change the way you live your life?
Some people nd that it makes them much more heedful and responsible, and
helps them cut away activities that merely clutter up their lives to no purpose.
Several times, I’ve proposed that they have clubs on another theme, which is:
Suppose you really believed in kamma and rebirth. How would you act? A person
who attended a class at which I mentioned this idea one time told me a year later
that he was really resistant to it, and so he asked himself why. He came to the


51

realization that if he believed in kamma and rebirth, he’d have to act in a much
more responsible way. at’s what’s called a pragmatic proof.

Q: Is there any scienti c evidence for rebirth?
A: No. Is there any scienti c evidence for no rebirth? No. But just because you
can’t prove the issue scienti cally either way doesn’t mean that you should be
agnostic about it. Every time you act, you have to calculate whether the eﬀort put
into it will be worth the results obtained. And when you calculate the results, you
have to go on an assumption: How far into the future will those results go? You
can’t simply say, “I don’t know,” and leave it at that. You have to decide to take a
position. e Buddha’s simply telling you that, based on his experience, and the
experience of other noble ones, you’d be wise to assume that your actions will give
results based on the quality of your intentions, and that those actions can keep
giving results over many lifetimes. e Buddha never tried to prove rebirth but, as
I said, he did oﬀer a pragmatic proof: that if you believe in rebirth and you
believe that your actions will have an impact on how you’re reborn, you’ll tend to
act in a much more skillful way than if you don’t believe those things. In other
words, it’s a good working hypothesis to take on. Now, you will nd at awakening
that you con rm the truth of these hypotheses, but until then, you have to go by
the pragmatic proof.

Q: e ve aggregates (khandhas) disband at the moment of death. So, what
is the support for kamma to pass from life to life?
A: It’s important to realize that the ve aggregates are not the de nition of
what you are. In fact, the Buddha never de nes what you are. He says the
question, “What am I?” is a question that you should put aside. And as for how
kamma gets transmitted from one life to the next, the Buddha said that’s one of
those questions that, if you pursue them, drive you crazy. So, all you have to know
is that kamma can pass from life to life, and try to make the best kamma you can.

Q: What, in the view of the forest tradition, is rebirth and what actually is
being reborn into a new life?
A: Rebirth happens on many levels. e process by which you create states of
becoming—bhava—in your mind right now is the same process that will take you
from this body to another body when this body dies. Basically, the process of


52

becoming is that you start with a desire, then you get in touch with the world in
which that desire might be relevant, and then you take on an identity in that
world. Birth is when you move into that identity in that world. Now, the “world”
here may be a world in your mind, but it can also be an outside world. e
process is the same in both cases.
As for the question of what gets reborn, that was another one of the questions
the Buddha never answered. It’s like asking: When you go from one dream to
another, what moved from the rst dream to the second dream? e question
doesn’t make sense. e question that is important, though, is: How does that
movement come about? It’s the important question because that’s something
you’re doing and something you can learn not to do. Or, if you have to do it, you
can learn how to do it skillfully.

Q: In Buddhism is there a god who controls kamma?
A: No, everybody in the Buddhist universe is controlled by kamma, even the
gods.

Q: Could you please explain the wheel of saṁsāra? What comes before and
what comes a er?
A: Saṁsāra is not really a wheel. It’s a process of wandering on through states
of becoming that the mind keeps creating. As the Buddha said, you cannot even
conceive of the beginning point to the process, and the process is not going to
end until you stop doing it. at’s what nibbāna is: You stop doing the process.

Q: Is there still consciousness a er parinibbāna?
A: Yes, but it’s a consciousness that’s not related to any of the six senses.

Q: Dear an Ajaan, I consider myself a Buddhist, yet I have little interest in
going all the way. Despite considerable suﬀering in the past and now, I sometimes
feel that a good rebirth would be okay. ere is much in everyday life that
provides meaning and contentment, and I try to do those things informed by
Buddhist ideas and practice. I’m very interested in meditation, nding a deep,
safe, inner refuge, but I’m not interested in nibbāna. So, can I consider myself a
Buddhist really? Am I a pretender, a fraud? Do I want to have my cake and eat it,
too? Deep thanks.


53

A: You can consider Buddhism as being like a table full of food and you’re free
to take what you want. But I’ve noticed that the person asking this question is
like 99% of most Buddhists, who are oﬀered both processed cheese and real
cheese on the table but want to take only the processed cheese. So, it’s perfectly
ne to take whatever you nd good from Buddhism, but don’t close your mind to
nibbāna. You might want to give real cheese a try some time.

Q: e second question: Are all forms of everyday happiness a zero-sum
process? I feel that there are several happinesses we have that don’t take away from
anybody else’s happiness: for example, the joy I feel in my children, which is
unconditional.
And the third question is: Not all pleasures are bad. Look at the eﬀect it has
on the mind. If it’s not unskillful, okay. So, if I don’t overindulge or sensualize,
and if I approach activities of work, relationship, arts, science, music, sports, etc.,
treating them skillfully, what’s wrong with that? Especially with respect to sexual
relations: If done with respect, not harming—i.e., with skillful means—isn’t it a
good complement to the pleasures of jhāna?
A: Do you have a plant in France that has roots that are very invasive to other
plants and foundations of buildings? Fig trees? Bamboo? You can see where I’m
going. You can have your pleasures as long as you’re trying to not harm anybody.
And some of these sensual pleasures actually are okay in combination with jhāna,
but some of them are like g trees and bamboo. If you plant bamboo right next to
your house, the roots can eventually destroy the house. Or to return to the image
of the buﬀet table, if you ll yourself up with processed cheese, there’s no room
for the real cheese.

Q: As you get old, you lose your illusions, you lose your taste for a lot of
things, and it’s very peaceful. Is there a point to cultivating disenchantment for
these things so that you don’t verge on sadness?
A: A large part of wisdom lies in realizing that the things you no longer have a
taste for were not really worth that much to begin with. e things that require
you to be young in order to be capable of doing them are not necessarily all that
good for you to be doing anyhow.
One of the purposes of contemplating dispassion is so that you can prepare
yourself to think in these ways when old age comes. Most people I know feel that


54

they’re getting old too early. I, for example, keep telling myself I’m too young to
be old. But the body changes and it doesn’t ask permission to do so. So, it’s good
to think about aging ahead of time. When you can think in this way, it helps clear
your mind so that you can focus on what’s really of value: your ability to squeeze
as much goodness out of your body and mind as you can, even as the body is
beginning to fall apart.




55

DAY FOUR
MORNING

Goodwill
is morning we’ll discuss mettā, which we translate as goodwill. is is the
second perfection coming under the section on discernment. It provides the heart
side to what is usually seen as a “head” perfection.
Notice: We translate mettā as “goodwill” and not as “love” or “loving-
kindness.” Pāli has another word for love, which is pema, as in Pema Chödron.
e Buddha warns against love because love involves partiality. As he says, there
are cases where love can give rise to love, but it can also give rise to hatred. Hatred
can give rise to love, and hatred can give rise to hatred.
For example, suppose you love Bernard. If someone does something nice to
Bernard, you’re going to like or love that person. If someone mistreats Bernard,
you’re going to hate that person. Now, suppose you hate Bernard. If someone does
something nice for him, you’re going to hate that person. If someone does
something nasty to Bernard, you’re going to love that person. So, as the Buddha
said, you can’t really trust love as a basis for social engagement because love is a
way of feeding on the other person, and it can lead to factionalism and
divisiveness.
One of the reasons why mettā is o en translated as love or loving-kindness is
because there’s a passage in the Canon—it’s in passage [§11] in the readings—
describing the love of a mother for her child. “As a mother would risk her life to
protect her child, her only child, even so, one should cultivate the heart
limitlessly with regard to all beings.” Sometimes that passage is translated to say
that you should love everyone the same way a mother would love her child—
which is a nice sentiment, but totally impossible.
What the passage is actually saying is that you should protect your goodwill for
all beings in the same way that a mother would protect her only child. In other
words, even if other people are mistreating you, you should protect your goodwill
for those people. Even if they’re going to kill you, you still protect your goodwill.
Remember the passage in the readings about how you’re being pinned down by


56

bandits and they’re sawing oﬀ your limbs. e Buddha says that you should still
have goodwill for them. Otherwise, if you allow yourself to feel ill will for them,
it’ll lead to a miserable rebirth, xated on thoughts of revenge. is is what the
image of the mother means. You protect your goodwill for everyone, even risking
your life to do so, despite whatever they may be doing, as a way of protecting
yourself.
Now, goodwill is an expression of discernment. As I said, it’s the heart side of
what’s usually regarded as a “head” quality. In terms of the factors of the noble
eightfold path, it’s a part of right resolve, one of the discernment factors. Right
resolve is based on the understanding that it’s perfectly ne to want true
happiness, but if you want your happiness to be true, it cannot depend on the
suﬀering of others. is understanding is what underlies the desire for goodwill:
Because you want a happiness that lasts, you have to be determined to extend
goodwill to others and to yourself so that you won’t do anything in your pursuit
of happiness that will cause harm. You want to be skillful in all your interactions
with other beings, regardless of whether those beings are good in your eyes or
bad.
At the same time, you also realize that true happiness is something that will
have to come from within, which means that your true happiness doesn’t con ict
with anyone else’s. is is why a wish for true happiness can be an unlimited
attitude, one you can extend to all beings. Love creates divisions, but goodwill can
erase divisions. You understand that true happiness is a good goal for you and for
all beings, and so you learn how to focus your desire on the causes of that
happiness: the perfections. In that way, every perfection is an expression of
goodwill.
To understand goodwill—to have right view about goodwill—it’s important
to understand its relationship to kamma.
• e rst lesson from the teaching of kamma is its explanation of what it
means to wish others well. For people to be happy, they have to act skillfully. So,
when you extend goodwill to others, you hope that they will understand the
causes for true happiness and be willing and able to act on them. In other words,
you’re not simply wishing them to be happy, whatever they’re doing right now.
A er all, they may be doing some very unskillful things.
I once had a student from San Francisco who was having problems with her
landlord. e landlord was going to sell the property and wanted all of the renters


57

to lie about the rent that they were paying, and my student didn’t know what to
do. She told me, “Well, I’ve been spreading goodwill to him and imagining him
with a beautiful house and a swimming pool and many girlfriends.” I said, “No,
no, no, no. You don’t understand goodwill. First get together with the other
renters and then go as a group to talk to the landlord. Spread thoughts of
goodwill to him by guring out what you can do so that he won’t make you lie.
A er all, not getting you to lie would be for his long-term welfare and happiness.”
In other words, goodwill is not a magic wand to make people happy and
prosperous. You’re thinking, “What can I do to help these people act more
skillfully?” If they’re really set on doing unskillful things, you think, “What can I
do to help these people have a change of heart?” at’s the rst lesson that
kamma gives to goodwill.
• e second lesson concerns what’s involved in creating a mind state of
goodwill in yourself. Unlimited goodwill is not an innate feature of the mind. It’s
simply one of the possibilities that exist in the mind, together with many
unskillful possibilities. As the Buddha once said, the mind is more variegated
than the animal kingdom. Just think of all the diﬀerent kinds of animals there are
on land, in the ocean, in the air: Your mind is capable of more variety than even
that. It’s also capable of changing its direction faster than anything else. is is
why the Buddha speaks of goodwill as a determination: something you make up
your mind to pursue continuously.
He also talks about goodwill as a kind of mindfulness, something you have to
consciously keep in mind. Otherwise—because it’s not innate—it’s very easy to
forget. You can be sitting and doing mettā for a week, “May all beings be happy,
may all beings be happy.” en you get out in your car and somebody cuts right in
front of you, “And may this being go to hell!” You’ve got to keep reminding
yourself that goodwill is an attitude you have to bring to every encounter with
others.
Here it’s good to remember the three kinds of fabrication we talked about last
night: bodily, verbal, and mental. Bodily fabrication is the breath, verbal
fabrication is how you talk to yourself, and mental fabrication covers the
perceptions you hold in mind, together with the feelings you create with the
other fabrications. Now, to create an attitude of goodwill, you have to use all
three kinds of fabrication. Breathe in a way that feels good in the body, and then
talk to yourself about why you need to have goodwill for this other person. en


58

hold in mind a perception that this will actually be good for you and the other
person, too. is will help to develop a feeling of pleasure associated with
goodwill.
For example, if your boss is doing something stupid, breathe calmly, and then
think about the good things the boss has done in the past, to erase any perception
you may have that the boss is a monster or a fool. Hold that perception in mind.
Something in your mind may rebel, asking, “Why think about this person’s
good aspects when he’s doing something so horrible right now?” e antidote for
that attitude is a perception—a mental fabrication—that the Buddha
recommends calling to mind: It’s as if you’re walking through a desert. You’re hot,
tired, trembling with thirst, and you come across a small footprint of a cow that
has a little bit of water in it. You realize if you tried to use your hand to scoop it
up, you’d make the water muddy. So, the only way to drink the water is to get
down on all fours and slurp it up.
Now, this is not a very digni ed posture. You would not want someone to
come along with an iPhone and take a picture of you and post it on Instagram.
However, you need the water, so you don’t worry about the dignity. In the same
way, you need to think about the goodness of other people, even if it seems
beneath you, because you need their goodness in order to nourish your goodness.
at’s a good perception to hold in mind, making it easier to think about the
goodness of other people for the sake of your own goodness.
Otherwise, you become like the two dogs in a cartoon I saw once in e New
Yorker. ey’re female dogs—they’re wearing make-up and lipstick—and they’re
sitting at a bar drinking cocktails. Both have very mean and cynical expressions
on their faces, and one of them is saying, “ ey’re all sons of bitches.” e point
there is that if everybody is a son of a bitch, then you’re going to be a son of a
bitch or a bitch yourself. So, for the sake of your own goodness, you try to think
of the goodness of other people.
ese are some ways in which you use the three kinds of fabrication to create
and maintain an attitude of goodwill.
• e third lesson that kamma teaches about goodwill concerns the reasons
for why you need it. Its function is to guarantee the skillfulness of your actions.
You want to make sure that your goodness is not dependent on the goodness of
others. Only when it is independent can you trust it. It should also not be
dependent on thoughts about whether other beings deserve your goodwill or not.

59

It depends more on the fact that you need your goodwill, to protect yourself from
doing unskillful things. is is why the Buddha talks about goodwill as a kind of
restraint. We usually think of goodwill as something open and wide, without
limits, but it does place certain restraints on what we do, say, and think, so that
we don’t do unskillful things that will harm ourselves or others.
Another reason why you need goodwill is that it helps to mitigate the eﬀects
of your past kamma. e Buddha has an image—another good perception to
hold in mind—that your past bad kamma is like a large lump of salt. If you put
that lump of salt into a small cup of water, you wouldn’t be able to drink the
water. However, if you put it into a large river of water, you could still drink the
water. e cup of water stands for a mind that has very limited goodwill for
others, whereas the river stands for a mind of unlimited goodwill. As the Buddha
said, if your mind is unlimited, then even though past bad kamma will give its
results, you hardly experience them at all.
• e teaching on kamma also teaches you about the karmic consequences of
developing goodwill, as in one of the passages given in the readings: “You sleep
easily; you wake easily; you dream no evil dreams; you are dear to human beings,
dear to non-human beings; the devas protect you; neither re, poison nor
weapons can touch you; you gain concentration quickly; your complexion is
bright; you die unconfused; and if you penetrate to no higher attainment, then
you are headed for the brahmā worlds.” Doesn’t sound bad.
• Another lesson coming from the teaching on kamma is how goodwill is best
expressed in your actions. It’s not necessarily best expressed through tenderness.
In ai, they have the concept of what they call high-level mettā, which is o en
attributed to the ajaans when they do or say something that you don’t like but is
good for you. Sometimes they can be quite sharp, but it’s for your own good.
I’ll give you an example. As my concentration was getting better when I was
practicing with Ajaan Fuang, he would say things to try to get me worked up. He
knew where my buttons were. At rst, I was upset: “I’m trying to keep my
concentration going, and here he is destroying it.” But then I nally realized what
was happening, so I told myself, “No matter what he says, I’m not going to let it
get me upset.” One evening I was talking with him. He had asked me to translate
one of Ajaan Lee’s books, and I happened to tell him that I had nished it that
a ernoon. Instead of saying that was good, he said, “ at’s your business, and
none of mine.” Fortunately, my mind was in good shape and the words just went


60

right past me. I said to myself as they went by, “ at was pretty nasty,” but my
vacuum cleaner was turned oﬀ, so I didn’t suck them in. en the next thing he
said was, “Good, in that case, we’ll nd someone to print the book.” I passed the
test. So, sometimes mettā can be very harsh but it still is conducive to well-being.
• Finally, the teaching on kamma requires that the way you live be in keeping
with thoughts of unlimited goodwill. e Karaṇīya Mettā Sutta talks about the
prerequisites for mettā: that you be content with few things, that you are easy to
instruct and easy to support, and that you have few duties. Now for monks, what
this means is you don’t have a lot of building projects. Otherwise, everyone who
comes into the monastery becomes a target for your desire to contribute to the
building project. It’s like the Shackleton expedition. When they were coming
back from the Antarctic, they stopped at an island and they had no food, which
meant that every penguin that walked onto the island was going to become a
meal. I think about that image every time I go to a monastery where they have a
building project that they’re promoting aggressively.
So, you have to live your life in a way that really is harmless and
unburdensome to other beings if you want your mettā to be sincere. is is how
the perfection of mettā connects with the perfections of truth, virtue, and
persistence. Goodwill is also nourishment for all the other perfections. If you
develop a mind state where you realize you have no ill will for anyone, it gives you
a sense of strength and nourishment, and as the Buddha says, it provides
protection for you in all directions, into the past and into the future.
What this requires, though, is that when you’re developing goodwill, you
don’t simply think over and over again, “May so-and-so be happy, may they be
happy, may they be happy.” You also have to think, “Is there anyone out there for
whom I cannot have genuine goodwill? Why can I not feel goodwill for this
person?” If they’re misbehaving, genuine goodwill means that you’re wishing that
they will have a change of heart: that they’ll change their ways and behave more
skillfully.
Now, is there anyone out there who you would like to see suﬀer before they
change their ways? If there is, ask yourself, “Okay, why? What are you feeding
on?” It’s usually a sense of revenge. And even though they say revenge is sweet, it’s
miserable food. It would actually be better for the world if the other person did
not suﬀer, because when people suﬀer, they rarely tell themselves, “Ah, this is the
result of my misbehavior. I should change my ways.” ey usually take it out on


61

other people, like the hummingbirds I talked about last night. So, for the sake of
your happiness and for the sake of everyone’s happiness, you want to be able to
express thoughts of goodwill even to very diﬃcult people. By working through
your ill will in this way, you can get to a place where you can genuinely feel
goodwill for everyone in all directions. And you’ll be protected in all directions as
well.

QUESTIONS

Q: Goodwill is o en associated with esteem or aﬀection for somebody, which
sometimes may be diﬃcult and sometimes even false. If you explain goodwill as a
wish for a person to behave better for that person’s own well-being, it’s a lot easier
to have goodwill, but doesn’t this put some restraint on what the meaning of
mettā is?
A: Mettā basically means goodwill. ere will be some people for whom your
aﬀection is naturally stronger, but can you really have that kind of strong aﬀection
for everybody? Remember you have to have mettā for snakes and spiders and
devious public gures. It’s hard to feel aﬀection in cases like that.

Q: Mettā is said to be like the love of a mother for her only child. But a
mother’s love for her child can be very undependable. ere are many mothers
who don’t love their children. Motherly love is not written into our genes.
A: As I said, there is that image in the Canon of a mother protecting her only
child, but the image is not describing mettā itself. e Buddha uses the image to
describe how you look a er your own goodwill. Just as a mother would protect
her only child with her life, you should protect your goodwill for all beings in the
same way. So, the Buddha’s not saying that mettā is like the love of a mother for
her child, he’s simply saying that you have to protect it in all circumstances, even
in very diﬃcult ones. As you pointed out, there are lots of mothers who don’t love
their children. And as I also noted, when the Buddha’s talking about love, he uses
another word. e Pāli word is pema, which he says is an emotion you cannot
trust because love can turn into hatred very easily.
So, as you say, mettā is not written into our genes. We develop mettā by
thinking about how, if our happiness depends on the suﬀering of other beings,



62

that happiness is not going to last. We have to take their well-being into
consideration.
Secondly, if you have ill will for other people, it’s going to be very easy for you
to mistreat them. at’s why, to protect yourself from your own unskillful actions,
you have to learn how to develop goodwill for everyone. Here, goodwill means
wishing, “May these beings be happy.” And remember, they’ll nd happiness
through being skillful in their own actions. So, basically, you’re wishing, “May
they learn how to be skillful in their actions,” and that you would be happy to
help them in that quest. With those thoughts in mind, you can develop goodwill.
ere’s a passage in the Canon that those of you who were in earlier retreats
will probably remember. King Pasenadi is in his private apartment with one of his
queens, ueen Mallikā, and in a tender moment he turns to her and says, “Is
there anyone you love more than yourself ?” You know what he’s thinking—like a
typical man: that she’s going to say, “Yes, your majesty, I love you more than I love
myself.” But this is the Pāli Canon, and ueen Mallikā is no fool. She says, “No,
there’s nobody I love more than myself. And how about you? Is there anybody
you love more than yourself ?” And the king has to admit: No, there isn’t. at’s
the end of that scene.
e king then goes to see the Buddha and reports their conversation. e
Buddha responds, “You know, she’s right. You could search the entire world and
you would never nd anyone you love more than yourself. Similarly, everyone else
loves themselves just that ercely.” But then the Buddha’s conclusion is not that
it’s a dog-eat-dog world and you should just grab whatever you want whenever
you can. Instead, he says, “If you really love yourself, then you should never harm
anybody else or get them to do harm.” e reason, as I said earlier, is that if your
happiness depends on their suﬀering, it’s not going to last. erefore, when you
realize that goodwill is in your own best interest, it’s a lot easier to develop
thoughts of goodwill.

Q: Does the act of mettā create an intention? And if so, for whom?
A: e idea of having goodwill for all beings is in and of itself an intention,
and it’s your intention. You’re the one who immediately bene ts from that. But if
you act on that intention, other beings will bene t, too.




63

Q: For many people, happiness lies in having someone near and dear to them:
their children, their grandchildren. It’s diﬃcult and perhaps not very wise to tell
them that their true happiness lies somewhere else and that they’re suﬀering from
an illusion.
A: Never tell anyone they’re suﬀering from an illusion, okay? Especially if
that’s where their happiness lies. You might indirectly try to let them know that
they have to develop another source of happiness as well. For instance, in addition
to having children and grandchildren, they can also learn how to meditate and
develop an internal source of well-being. Or they could also nd happiness
through being generous or virtuous. is way, you help provide them with an
alternative basis for happiness in case something ever happens to their children or
grandchildren. When you do this, what you’re telling them is actually an extra
gi . Instead of trying to take away the happiness they already have, you try to
provide them with an alternative basis.

Q: For our goodness and the goodness of others, is it always necessary to
accept and not say anything?
A: No, no, no, no, no.

Q: Can one express one’s feelings, for instance, when one has been wounded?
A: Yes. e question lies in learning how to express your feelings in a skillful
way. Ask yourself, “What is the best thing to say? When is the best opportunity
to say it?” You can say as much as you think is really necessary and with a good
cause. e important thing is that you not speak simply out of the force of your
emotion. And the second point is always to try to show respect for other people
when you’re criticizing them.
ey conducted a psychological experiment years back in which they took
couples, hooked them up with machines, and covered them with sensors to
measure such things as their heart rate and sweat rate. en they took a short
video of them as they discussed a topic that was a minor irritation in the
relationship. As it turned out, they didn’t use the heart rate or sweat rate
measurements at all. As was the case with many psychological experiments, the
sensors were a distraction. Instead, they took the videos and they slowed them
down, looking for the micro-expressions that would it over the couples’ faces as
they talked. What they discovered was that they could tell with pretty good


64

accuracy which relationships would last and which relationships would not—
which is kind of scary. If there was any micro-expression of contempt for the
other person, the relationship was not going to last. So, the important thing when
you criticize someone else is that you try to do it with an attitude of respect for
that person. In that way, the message you’re trying to get across will probably be
more happily received.

Q: How can we develop the skill of sending thoughts of kindness and love
from the bottom of our heart for those who have hurt us, instead of just using the
rational action of the mind? ank you.
A: You have to start with the rational action. Just keep reminding yourself that
you do not gain any bene t by seeing other people suﬀer. Remember what
goodwill means, which is, “May this person understand the causes for true
happiness and be willing and able to act on those causes.” In other words, you’re
wishing that that person would learn how to behave in a skillful and harmless
manner. Is there anyone out there for whom you cannot think that thought? In
other words, is there anyone you would like to see suﬀer rst before they become
skillful? Now, in some cases, part of your heart may say, “Yes.” You have to ask
that part, “What do you gain from seeing that person suﬀer?” And the correct
answer is, nothing really. Basically, you have to reason with your heart until the
heart is willing to believe that, yes, it really would be better to see this person
become more skillful, and that you’re willing to give up the satisfaction of getting
some revenge—because revenge is sweet, and we know that sweets are not good
for you.

Q: Could you please explain the phrase, “May I understand the causes for true
happiness and be willing and able to act on them.” How can I know the causes for
my happiness? And how can I act on those causes?
A: You begin with a general principle that true happiness has to be a
happiness that does not cause any harm, either to yourself or to others. So, you
look around: Is there anyone whose happiness is not causing any harm? en you
ask that person for advice. For example, you might take the Buddha’s advice. He
says that true happiness comes from generosity, virtue, and developing universal
goodwill. Now, this answer makes sense because you don’t harm anyone with
generosity or with virtue or with universal goodwill, and yet it’s possible to be


65

happy doing these things. So, you try developing these practices within yourself.
When you see the results arising, that’s when you know for yourself.

Q: Does mettā actually act on other people or beings? If so, what’s the
mechanism?
A: In some cases, yes, it does act on other people. It’s as if your mind is a radio
transmitter and other people are like radios. Sometimes the radio transmitter is
very weak and sometimes it’s strong. Sometimes other people have their radios
turned on; sometimes they don’t. As for the mechanism: ink about light. Light
is waves, but nobody knows waves of what. We don’t really know how light
works, but we can still use it. In the same way, you don’t have to know how mettā
works in order to get good use out of it.

Q: What is animosity?
A: Animosity is the desire to get revenge. To be free of animosity means two
things: One, no one has any thoughts of getting revenge against you, and, two,
you have no thoughts of getting revenge against other people.

Q: I feel sel sh and I don’t know love, even for my relatives. What can I do to
awaken love for others, a love that is universal and disinterested?
A: When you meditate, spend some time thinking about how much your
current position in life depends on other people—the people who taught you
how to speak, the people who taught you all the diﬀerent types of knowledge you
use, the work of all the people who keep society going—until it really hits home
that you are dependent on many, many, many other people. en you can ask
yourself, “What am I doing to pay them back?” Maybe some sense of gratitude
will come, and from gratitude, a sense of goodwill.
You’ve answered my question about sel shness and love, advising me to
meditate upon them. What are the steps for performing this kind of meditation,
and what’s the diﬀerence between that and meditating by focusing on the breath?
A: is is a kind of meditation in which you’re actively using your analytical
mind. In this case, you should try thinking about the areas in which you should
be grateful to others for the help you’ve received. Start with the fact that if you
didn’t have parents, you wouldn’t be here. If you didn’t have teachers, there would
be a great deal you wouldn’t know. en think of all the people who you’ve never


66

met whose work you’ve depended on. In other words, you start with people who
are close to you and then you cast your thoughts out further and further away.
en you come back to the present moment, realizing that the people you
depend on are all around you.

Q: In spreading thoughts of mettā to politicians who are harming people—I
won’t name names—I nd that I don’t really care about their happiness. I just
want them to stop causing harm. Is that wrong?
A: ere’s nothing wrong with it at all. But try to have some compassion for
those politicians. If they really are harming people, they’re creating a lot of bad
kamma for themselves. ey’re really deluded. And who knows, maybe someday
in the future, you may be a politician, too, and it would be good for your
populace to have compassion for you.

Q: Can I spread mettā to a situation in the past or for a diﬃcult situation that
I anticipate in the future?
A: You don’t spread mettā to situations, you spread mettā to beings. So, with
regard to the situation in the past, spread goodwill to all the beings who were
involved in that situation, wherever they are now. As for a diﬃcult situation in
the future, spread thoughts of goodwill to all the people who will be involved.

Q: Is it valid to send mettā to a person no longer in this world, one to whom I
felt resentment and who had resentment toward me?
A: is is a very good practice to do. It’s one way of bringing your own mind
to some peace. You have to remember that when people die, they don’t go out of
existence. ey get born again. So, they’re always there someplace for you to
spread mettā to. Now, whether that person rejoices in your mettā or not, that’s
that person’s business. But if you can spread goodwill to someone you used to
resent, that takes a huge burden oﬀ of your mind.

Q: Sending mettā to a friend who has died: Does the mettā get to them even
though that person has been reborn as a turtle or a plant?
A: People don’t get reborn as plants, but it is possible for them to become
turtles. So, yes, it is possible for the turtle to receive the thoughts of mettā and to
bene t from them. ere are many stories in the forest tradition of the ajaans


67

sending mettā to animals of diﬀerent kinds and of the animals responding to
them in appropriate ways.

Q: I’ve heard in previous talks and Dhamma teachings that emotions such as
love for parents and friends are attachments. Should they be changed for
impersonal love? Would that be a price to pay for awakening?
A: You will always have your love for your parents and friends, and the
Buddha says that you have a special debt of gratitude to your parents, so they
always will be special to you. It’s simply that as you practice, your idea of how you
can best help them will develop. For instance, getting them more interested in
meditation, getting them interested in being generous: You come to realize that
that’s the best way to express your love and repay your debt to your parents and to
your friends.

EVENING

Truth
Tonight, we start our discussion of the second set of perfections, coming
under the heading of truth. And we start with the perfection of truth itself.
We all desire truth, but we don’t start out with a disinterested desire for true
information or truth in the abstract. Our desire for truth starts with our most
basic response to pain, which, as the Buddha noted, is twofold: One, we’re
bewildered as to why it’s happening. Two, we search for someone who might
know how to put an end to the pain.
ink of a baby suﬀering from the sharp pains of indigestion. It has no idea
what’s happening. All it knows is that it wants someone to come and help get rid
of the pain. As we grow older, we gain more understanding, largely from what
we’ve learned from other people, as to how to deal with pain. But our basic
response is still the same: Why does there have to be pain to begin with? And is
there anyone who can help us with the more complicated suﬀerings, not only of
the body but also of the mind?
Our desire for truth comes from this combination of bewilderment and
search. We’d like to nd the reality of a true happiness, untainted by pain, a


68

happiness that doesn’t disappoint us. From that desire, we search for people who
are true in having done what it takes to gain genuine knowledge about how to put
an end to pain, and who are willing to give us true information about what
they’ve learned. As we mature, we want to be true in following the path set out by
that true information. In other words, we turn our desire for truth into a
determination to be true. is gives us three kinds of truth—the truth of a reality,
the truth of perceptions and statements, and the truth of a person—all of which
come under the perfection of truth.
is is re ected in the fact that the Pāli word for truth, sacca, has the same
three meanings. First, there’s truth as a quality of the person. To begin with, a true
person is someone who is honest and accountable: someone who realizes that
actions have consequences, and is willing to take responsibility for what he or she
has done. is was one of the qualities that the Buddha said he looked for in a
student. As he said, “Bring me an observant person who is honest and no
deceiver, and I will teach that person the Dhamma.” At the same time, a true
person—motivated by the desire to put an end to suﬀering—will earnestly stick
with the path to that goal, despite any hardships it may entail.
A person who is true in these ways will want to look for a teacher who is also
true in these ways. If you’re earnest in wanting to put an end to suﬀering, you’ll
want someone who has earnestly followed the path, and is truly reliable in
judging the results of his or her own practice. People of integrity are most
con dent when they’re associating with other people of integrity.
is kind of truth—in which you are a true person: honest, reliable,
accountable, and earnest—is a quality that is held to across the board throughout
the practice.
e word “truth” can also apply to perceptions and to statements. In other
words, you perceive Philippe as Philippe. at’s a true perception. You say,
“Philippe is wearing a blue-grey jacket right now.” at, too, is also a truth: the
truth of a statement.
en there’s truth of a reality. For instance, whether or not we perceive this
bowl as a bowl, it exists on its own and—at least for now—it has its own reality in
existing as an object. In the Buddha’s teachings, this point particularly applies to
nibbāna, which is a reality that’s always true.
So, there are three kinds of truth: the truth of a person, the truth of a
perception or a statement, and the truth of a reality in and of itself.


69

e Buddha’s teachings contain a paradox around the issue of truth. On the
one hand, truth is one of the perfections, and guarding the truth is one of the
determinations. On the other hand, we’re sometimes told to learn how not to
cling to our views of the truth. So, the question is: how to combine these two
teachings in practice.
e paradox can be resolved when we note that these teachings apply to
diﬀerent aspects of truth. e issue of not clinging to truths applies primarily,
one, to our perceptions and statements, and two, to the need to let go of all
clingings, even clinging to the truth, in order to attain the truth of the ultimate
fact of nibbāna at the end of the path.
With regard to perceptions and statements, you always try to make them true,
but you have to realize that perceptions and statements have their limitations.
Sometimes our perceptions can seem true when they’re not. Some statements
may be true for some situations, but not for other situations. You always try to
perceive and tell the truth, but there’s always the possibility that your perceptions
—and the statements based on them—may be wrong. So, you have to realize that
these truths have their limitations. is is why, when you decide to act on views
you’ve formulated or picked up from others, you have to be careful to test them in
your actions to see how true they actually are. In addition, you’ll nd that there
are some levels of the practice where one statement or set of instructions is true
and useful, and another level of the practice where it’s no longer useful. On that
level, you have to let that particular truth go.
As for letting go of all clinging to truth, regardless of the type, that comes only
at the end of the practice. As long as there’s the slightest amount of clinging in the
mind, it can’t reach the highest level of freedom. But to get to the point where we
can let go of all truths, we have to deal skillfully with truths in the meantime.
To explain how we do that, the Buddha distinguishes truths in another way,
based on the verb that’s appropriate for dealing with diﬀerent kinds of truth: the
truth
• as something you perceive;
• as something you tell;
• as something you guard;
• as something you awaken to and, in awakening to it, you go beyond it.




70

Perceiving, of course, relates to truths as perceptions. Telling relates to truths
as statements. Guarding relates to how you recognize the sources and reasons for
your perceptions and statements. But, as we’ll see, awakening to the truth involves
all four kinds of truths—truths of a person, of perceptions, of statements, and the
truths of facts or realities in and of themselves—before you let go of them all.
Let’s look in more detail at these four ways of relating to the truth.
• First, perceiving a truth: As a meditator, you try to make your perceptions as
accurate as possible. is is especially important in mindfulness practice because
you want to recognize what’s happening in the mind and in the body as it’s
actually happening. For instance, you want to be able to recognize a hindrance as
a hindrance. If something skillful arises in the mind, you want to perceive it as
skillful. In that way, you can act appropriately with regard to such things as they
happen. is is where truth as a perfection diﬀers from truth as one of the virtues
in the ve precepts. When you’re telling the truth in line with the precepts, all
you have to do is say, “ is is how I perceive things.” If it turns out that the
perception is wrong, you haven’t lied and you’ve maintained your virtue. But as
you’re trying to develop the perfection of truth, you have to put your best eﬀort
to make sure your perceptions really are accurate.
• e second verb in your relationship to truth is that it’s something you tell.
Here, the Buddha particularly emphasizes being accountable, in other words,
truthful in how you report your own behavior, as when he was teaching his son
Rāhula how to be observant and truthful. You may know the story. e Buddha
comes to see Rāhula when the latter is a seven-year-old novice. Rāhula sets out a
jar of water and a dipper, and the Buddha washes his feet with the water in the
dipper. You get the impression that Rāhula may have told a lie that day, because
that’s the very rst thing the Buddha mentions to Rāhula: lying. He leaves a little
bit of water in the dipper, shows it to Rāhula, and says, “Do you see how little
water there is in this dipper?” Rāhula says, “Yes.” e Buddha says, “ at’s how
little goodness there is in a person who tells a deliberate lie and feels no shame.”
en the Buddha throws the water away and says, “Do you see how that water has
been thrown away?” Rāhula says, “Yes.” e Buddha says, “ at’s what happens to
the goodness of a person who tells a deliberate lie with no sense of shame. It gets
thrown away.” en he shows him the dipper. “Do you see how empty this dipper
is?” Rāhula says, “Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.” And the Buddha says, “ at’s how empty
you are of goodness if you tell a deliberate lie with no sense of shame.”


71

en, a er having established the importance of being truthful, the Buddha
teaches the importance of being observant. In other words, he’s teaching Rāhula
to be the ideal student: honest and observant. He says, “You should look at your
actions as you would look at yourself in a mirror. Before you do something, ask
yourself what you expect the consequences will be. If you foresee any harm, don’t
do the action. If you don’t foresee any harm, go ahead and do it. While you’re
doing the action, see what actual results are coming about. If you see that you’re
causing harm, stop. If you don’t see any harm, go ahead and continue with the
action. A er the action is done, look at the long-term results of the action. If you
see that you caused harm, go talk it over with someone who is more advanced on
the path so that you can get some idea of what you might do the next time
around to avoid causing harm. But if you don’t see that you caused any harm, you
can take joy in the fact that your practice is improving, and continue on the path
day and night.”
e important point here is that if you nd that you’ve made a mistake, you
talk it over with somebody, because this is how you learn. is is why we have the
Saṅgha as a container for the practice, and why the Buddha said that having
admirable friends is necessary for the practice. e only way you can take
advantage of having that admirable friend is to be truthful in reporting your
mistakes. If you hide your mistakes from other people, you start hiding them
from yourself.
is is another aspect of truth—truth in telling statements—that the Buddha
says to hold to, all the way along the path.
• e third verb that indicates how to relate to truth is that you should
“guard” the truth. is has two meanings in the suttas.
In MN 140—the sutta that lists the four determinations—guarding the truth
means attaining the truth of nibbāna and, by extension, everything you do along
the path to reach that attainment. MN 95, however, breaks the path to nibbāna
down into several steps related to the truth, with only the rst step called
“guarding the truth.” By that, it means that you’re very clear about where you get
your perceptions and statements. As the Buddha said, sometimes we get our ideas
simply from our own conviction or preferences. For example, you go online. If
you like le -leaning cartoonists, you’ll go to the le -leaning cartoonists. If you
like right-wing cartoonists, you’ll go to the right-wing cartoonists. You pick up
their ideas because you like them. Sometimes you pick up an idea because you


72

believe in a tradition; sometimes you reason through an idea and if it ts with
things you already believe, you adopt it because it strikes you as reasonable.
Now, none of these approaches are adequate bases for knowing whether
something is really true or not. is is one of the areas where you have to learn
how not to be attached to your views. When you hold a particular view as a basis
for your actions, you have to ask yourself, “Where did I get this view? Why did I
accept it?” As you examine this issue, you begin to realize that many of the things
you thought you knew are actually based on liking or belief. So, as you practice,
it’s always important to keep this fact in mind, because you have to remember
that there are a lot of things you don’t know about in the practice and in the
world.
is doesn’t mean that you should take no position on things you don’t fully
know. A er all, to practice, you need to make assumptions and adopt working
hypotheses about the nature and power of action in order to motivate yourself
and to direct your practice, even though you don’t yet fully know the nature and
power of action. You have to ask yourself, “What views are useful to adopt, and
for what reason? And how can I train myself to develop true knowledge about
these issues? Where do I start?”
One place to start is to learn how to observe the impact on your mind of
adopting a particular view: what it will lead you to do. But here there’s a problem,
because all too o en we’re not very familiar even with our own minds. is is why
we have to meditate: to learn how to observe when the mind is creating suﬀering
and when it’s not. You look for the truth of suﬀering and all the other noble
truths as facts in and of themselves. at’s how you move from guarding the truth
to awakening to the truth.
• In MN 95, the Buddha describes many stages in the process of how you
awaken to the truth.
You start by entering into what we would call a true relationship. You have to
nd a true person to be your teacher. How do you nd a true person? You observe
the person closely and ask yourself three questions: First, does this person have
the sort of greed, aversion, or delusion that would make him claim to know
something he doesn’t know? Second, does this person ever tell someone else to
do something that would not be in that other person’s best interest? ird, is the
Dhamma taught by this person the type that would require an observant person
to realize it?


73

To nd someone who passes that test requires, of course, that you have some
truth in yourself, because as the Buddha says, true people can recognize true
people, but a person who is not true can’t tell who’s true and who’s not. is
places a lot of responsibility on you.
In this way, awakening to the truth starts with being a true person and looking
for another true person to teach you.
Once you believe you’ve found such a person, then you enter into a true
relationship with him or her. Listen to the Dhamma that that person teaches—
using perceptions and statements—and then think it over until you decide that it
seems bene cial and makes sense. at will give rise to a desire to practice. is is
the desire you nurture to develop all the perfections, and this is how it’s nurtured:
By nding an honest person whose Dhamma seems bene cial and makes sense.
e actual practice starts with your looking at your behavior and comparing it
to the Dhamma. Wherever your behavior does not measure up, you try to bring it
up to standard. is is a principle that the Buddha calls practicing the Dhamma
in accordance with the Dhamma. In other words, you change your behavior to t
in with the Dhamma instead of trying to change the Dhamma to t your
preferences. is moves from the truth of statements and perceptions to the truth
of a person.
Being true in this way will o en require doing some things that you don’t like
doing, and also relinquishing some things that you’d prefer to hold on to. As a
true person, when you see that something needs to be done, you really do it. If
something needs to be given up, you really give it up.
is is something that the Buddha himself said was one of his own
characteristics: Once he’d given something up, he really gave it up and would
never pick it up again. You probably know the story. e Buddha le many hints
for Ven. Ānanda to invite him to continue living for a longer time, but Ānanda
kept missing the hints, until nally the Buddha decided, “Okay, I’m going to give
up my will to live longer.” ere was an earthquake, so Ānanda came to see the
Buddha and asked, “Why the earthquake?” And the Buddha informed him, “I’ve
given up my will to live longer.” Ānanda said, “Could you please change your
mind and decide to live longer?” e Buddha replied, “If there’s something I’ve
given up, I’ve really given it up. I can’t take it back.”
So, you awaken to the truth by being true in giving up the things that need to
be given up, and in doing the things that need to be done. You follow the


74

Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, and in that way you arrive at the
truth of the end of suﬀering.
At this point, the Dhamma you’ve attained is a reality. It’s no longer
statements; it’s no longer perceptions. Nibbāna is a truth in and of itself. It’s a
fact. Once you’ve arrived there, you can let go of all the right views and other
things that you developed leading up to that point that got you there. In fact, you
have to let them go. Otherwise, you can’t reach the full awakening that comes
from having no clinging at all.
So, when we’re told not to be attached to views, it has two meanings. One is
realizing that many of the statements and perceptions you assume to be true are
based on your preferences and on information that may or may not be true. ose
are areas where you have to maintain a measure of detachment from your views.
Even with your right views, you have to realize that there may be things that you
don’t yet really know—especially about when and how they should be applied.
Your right views still have to be tested by trying to develop all the factors of the
path until, by following them, you arrive at the reality of the end of suﬀering.
ere’s an example in the Canon. A man once came to see the Buddha and
was very impressed. He went back and told a friend, “You know, that Buddha: He
really is awakened.” e friend said, “Why do you think that?” And the man said,
“Well, I see these people coming to argue with the Buddha, and even before they
open their mouths they get converted. It’s like coming across large elephant
footprints in a forest and knowing, ‘ is must be a bull elephant.’” Impressed, the
friend responded, “Gee, I’d really like to meet the Buddha some day.”
He goes to see the Buddha and tells him what the rst man said. e Buddha
says, “Actually, that’s not the right use of the elephant footprint simile.” en he
explained the proper use of the simile, saying, “Suppose an experienced elephant
hunter goes into the forest. He wants a bull elephant because he needs a big bull
elephant to do some heavy work. He sees some big elephant footprints, but
because he’s an experienced hunter, he doesn’t immediately jump to the
conclusion that these must be the footprints of a big bull elephant. Why is that?
Because sometimes there are dwarf females with big feet. But the prints look
likely, so he follows them. He sees some scratch marks up in the trees. But still he
doesn’t jump to the conclusion that these must be scratch marks le by the tusks
of a big bull elephant. Why is that? Sometimes there are tall females with tusks.
Still, the marks look likely, so he follows them. Finally he comes across a big


75

clearing, and there in the clearing is a big bull elephant. at’s when he knows he’s
got the elephant he wants.”
“So,” the Buddha says, “in the same way, when you’re practicing and you gain
the diﬀerent levels of concentration, it’s like seeing the footprints of the elephant.
Even if you gain diﬀerent psychic powers, they’re like scratch marks on the trees.
Only when you have a direct experience of the deathless do you know that you’ve
got the bull elephant you want.” In other words, only when you gain your rst
taste of awakening do you know for sure that the Buddha was truly awakened,
that awakening is really a fact, and that the perceptions and statements the
Buddha employed to teach about awakening and how to get there are really true.
What this means is that, as we’re practicing, we’re going by the strength of our
conviction. is conviction becomes knowledge only with awakening. So, as long
as we’re still on the path, we should always be open to the fact that there is more
to learn. As I said earlier, this is why right views are called right views, rather than
right knowledge. We remember that they’re working hypotheses we adopt for the
sake of the practice, but we don’t yet know them for sure. is is one way in
which we’re not attached to our views. ey seem to make sense and they’re
worth putting into practice because of the good actions they inspire, but we
realize that there’s always more to learn. We adopt them for the sake of our own
happiness, so there’s no need for us to impose them on others.
Only when you’ve attained awakening do you have the reality. At that point,
perceptions and statements don’t have that much importance to you, because
you’ve found the true fact they were aiming at. And to fully experience that truth,
you have to let go of the views that got you there. In fact, you have to be careful
not to cling even to the reality of awakening if you want to fully attain it. You
have to let go of everything. But don’t worry, you won’t be le adri . e reality
of awakening isn’t something that has to be fabricated or maintained. You don’t
have to cling to it to keep it going. It’s there on its own, independent of
conditions, to be experienced only when the mind is totally free of clinging. is
is the second way in which you have to learn not to cling to the truth.
But as we practice, even though we should always be willing to admit that
there’s more for us to learn, we have to work with a sense that there is a right and a
wrong way of practicing, and a right and a wrong way of understanding the
practice. In other words, you can’t say, “I’m just going to be beyond views and not
have any opinions.” You have to remember that the Buddha’s truths have an attha,


76

a purpose, and you need to use each truth for the purpose for which it was
intended if you want to get the most out of it.
In simple terms, this means you need to know how a truth is to be used in
giving guidance in what is correct to do and what’s not correct to do. At the same
time, you also have to be true in being willing to keep looking at the results of
your actions and to learn from them, to admit a mistake when you’ve caused
harm.
One way in which this is particularly important is that some truths may be
useful for certain parts of the practice but not useful for others. For example, we
may have heard that the teachings on the three characteristics talk about how
things are inconstant, stressful, and not-self. First, though, it’s important to know
that the Buddha never called these three “characteristics.” He called them
“perceptions,” and the important point about them as perceptions is knowing
when to apply them and when not.
For example, when you’re practicing the precepts, you don’t say, “Oh, my
actions are inconstant, stressful, and not-self, so I don’t have to be responsible.”
You have to hold on to the precepts. You apply the perceptions of inconstancy,
stress, and not-self to the things that would induce you to break the precepts.
Similarly, when you practice concentration: You’re trying to give rise to a state of
mind that’s constant, easeful, and is under your control, which means that you’re
actually ghting against the three perceptions. You apply the three perceptions
only to things that would pull you out of concentration, things like sensual desire
and ill will. Only a er you’ve totally developed the path do you apply these
perceptions to everything, to let go of everything—including the three
perceptions themselves.
is ts in with what the Buddha said about his own statements, which is that
they would always be true. However, even if something was true but not
bene cial, he wouldn’t talk about it. And even if it was true and bene cial but it
was not the right time, he wouldn’t talk about it. In the same way, when we’re
applying his teachings, we have to ask, “Is this true? Is it bene cial for me? And is
this the right time for me?” If you apply these standards to the teachings, that’s
one of the ways in which you guard the truth and develop the perfection of truth
at the same time. at will help you to awaken to the truth, which is not about
perceptions, not about words, but is an independent reality in and of itself.



77

Now, that reality is always there, regardless of whether we nd it or not.
Similarly, the statements and perceptions have their truth regardless of how
clearly we realize that truth. Where we make a diﬀerence is in always telling the
truth, always trying to perceive the truth, and in always being true: earnest and
accountable. e more true we are in applying ourselves to the practice and
observing the results, adjusting our actions to make them more and more
harmless, the closer we come to understanding the truth of the Buddha’s
perceptions and statements, and the closer we come to the reality we want:
unconditioned happiness. If we don’t want to be true in our actions and in
observing their results, we won’t know who else is true, we won’t be able to test
the truth of their statements—and we may be content to let them lie to us when
they tell us that the path to true happiness doesn’t require eﬀort, honesty, or
strong powers of self-observation. Remember that in testing the teachings, you’re
also testing yourself. And the more true you are with yourself, the more likely you
are to nd the truth in the teaching.
To summarize, of all the forms of truth, the most important ones to hold on to
are to tell the truth and to be true. ose forms of truth will enable us to know
the other forms of truth, and to reach the genuine reality of unconditioned
happiness. When we nd that happiness—and only then—our desire for truth
will be fully satis ed.

QUESTIONS

Q: Your teaching says in a simple way that I need to develop good qualities so
as to be able to recognize bad qualities in an instructor or someone else, with
which I totally agree. On the other side, I’ve heard that if I identify bad qualities
in other people, it means that I must have these bad qualities in myself and I
should work on that, with which I partially agree.
A: at’s not always the case. If you used to kill and then you stop killing, you
can still identify who’s killing, and the same applies to other qualities in the mind.
It’s not the case that we’re not allowed to judge people. We have to be able to pass
some judgment on whom we can trust and whom we cannot trust. We’re not
passing nal judgment on the person, but we do have to judge whether this is a
person we can trust or not. As the Buddha said, the most important external
factor in making progress in the Dhamma is admirable friendship, so you have to


78

be able to judge who’s an admirable friend and who’s not. ere’s an article called
“ e Power of Judgment” on the website dhammatalks.org that deals with this
issue in detail.

Q: e last words of the teaching on sacca, or truth, lead me back to a
question I o en have, which is: e choices I make about my spiritual path, the
strategies I apply—are they appropriate? Are they judicious? Since the truth can
be valid on some levels and not valid on other levels of the path, am I simply
following my preferences? Of course, it depends on discernment, but are there
also other qualities? It’s been mentioned that one has to know where one is on the
path in order to practice in accordance with that level, but it’s not so easy to be
clear on this subject. As Ajaan Chah would say, “It is sure but not certain.” Of
course, it has to do with the views that we have about ourselves and the profound
intentions concerning others. It seems to me that on such a matter, a mistaken
evaluation can have heavy consequences.
A: ere are two qualities that help protect you on the path, and those are the
two qualities that, as I said, the Buddha looked for in any student: one, that you
be observant; and two, that you be honest. Now, this also includes being honest
with yourself. And as I mentioned in the discussion of the Buddha’s teachings to
Rāhula, what’s important is that you test any teaching by putting it into practice.
You look at your intentions for adopting the teaching, and then you also look at
the results that come about when you put it into practice. As long as you’re
operating on what you see as good intentions and you apply this training in being
more honest with looking at your intentions and at the results of your actions,
that will help keep you on the path.
ink of Ajaan Mun as an example. He was oﬀ in the forest alone. Sometimes,
while meditating, he would have visions of devas coming to him with teachings.
If he had believed everything they said, he would have gone crazy. As he told his
students, no matter who or what the teaching comes from, what matters is: If you
put it to the test, what happens as a result? at way of testing the teachings was
what got him on the right path and kept him there. So, your own honesty about
your intentions and the results of your actions is what protects you.

DAY FIVE
MORNING

Virtue
e Pāli term for virtue, sīla, can also mean morality, precept, or habit. Here
the perfection of virtue is a matter of developing the moral virtue of restraint. As
we pointed out at the very beginning, one of the insights that come from
discernment is that all things are rooted in desire. e desire that underlies virtue
is the desire to exercise restraint over your unskillful intentions, both as a
kindness to yourself and as a kindness to others.
is kind of virtue is related to the ve precepts. Sometimes, when referring to
the precepts, the Buddha would replace the word sīla with sikkhāpada, which
literally means “training rule.” e precepts are training rules that you take on for
the purpose of reaching the goal—abstaining from activities that would harm the
mind or get in the way of the goal—in the same way that an athlete would
undertake training rules as part of his or her regimen: abstaining from certain
foods and activities that would harm the strength and tness of the body.
e fact that these are rules for the purpose of training carries some important
implications. ey are not meant to be rules for creating a perfectly harmless
world. ey’re meant instead to cover only the range of actions for which you are
directly responsible: what you do and what you tell others to do. If you’re very
careful in these areas, that’s good enough for the purpose of training the mind to
get out of the world entirely.
Now, the precepts are very short: no killing, no stealing, no illicit sex, no
lying, no taking of intoxicants. Period. No ifs, ands, or buts. In other words, these
are precepts that, once you’ve chosen to take them, you try to follow at all times,
in all cases. At the same time, you don’t tell anyone else to break them, and you
don’t express approval when other people have broken them.
Sometimes you hear people complaining that they don’t like the idea of short
rules like this and that they’d prefer to have virtue expressed in more general
principles—such as kindness or gentleness—but for the purpose of training, it’s
really good to have rules that are clear-cut because they draw clear lines between


80

what should and shouldn’t be done. If the lines are not clear, it’s very easy to make
excuses for making exceptions. Unskillful desires can come in and change the
precept to something else. You nd that when you train children, if you provide
them with very clear-cut rules, the children are much happier because they can
have a clear sense of what’s right and what’s wrong. And you know that if you’re
following the rules, there’s a sense of self-esteem that comes from your ability to
stick with the rules.
A couple of the precepts require special explanation. For instance, the precept
against illicit sex basically refers to having sex with minors, having sex with
someone who is married to somebody else or in a committed relationship, or
having sex with someone who’s taken a vow of celibacy. If you’re already in a
committed relationship and you go outside the relationship, that would also be
breaking the precept as well.
en there’s the precept against lying. “Lying” here is de ned as
misrepresenting the truth. It doesn’t cover all forms of wrong speech, because
wrong speech also includes divisive speech, harsh speech, and idle chatter.
Divisive speech is anything said with the intention of breaking friends apart or of
preventing a relationship from developing. Harsh speech is when you say
something with the intention of hurting someone’s feelings. Idle speech is when
you say something without really knowing what your intention is. You just open
your mouth and see what comes out.
e reason there’s no precept against those three kinds of wrong speech is that
there are actually some cases where they can be skillful. For instance, with divisive
speech: Suppose you know that Mr. A is a very harmful person and he’s beginning
to get interested in having a relationship with Miss B. It might be a good idea to
warn Miss B about Mr. A. It’s because of examples like this that there’s no
absolute precept against divisive speech. Similarly with harsh speech: ere are
some cases where you have to use strong terms to say something very critical of
other people for their own good, in order to get their attention. at’s why there’s
no precept against harsh speech. As for idle chatter, every social situation requires
a little social grease to keep things going smoothly, so you speak about things that
help put everyone in a good mood. Just make sure that you don’t put too much
grease in the machine, because that can gum up the works.
So, those are the ve precepts. As I said earlier, there’s a certain amount of self-
esteem that comes when you can follow these rules, but these are not rules just for


81

the sake of rules. ey really are for your bene t.
By following the ve precepts, we’re embodying what we’ve learned from the
perfections of discernment, truth, and goodwill. At the same time, we provide the
conditions for strengthening the perfections of renunciation—in the practice of
concentration—and discernment.
To begin with, in line with the primacy that right view gives to your
intentions, the precepts focus your attention directly on your intentions in action.
at’s because you can break a precept only intentionally. For example, if you
happen to walk down the middle of the room here and step on a bug
unintentionally, you’re not breaking a precept. It’s only if you see the bug and
deliberately squash it, that’s when you break the precept. e diﬀerence has to do
with the state of your mind. Basically, the precepts are taught for helping you to
train your intentions. If you notice the desire to break the precept, you realize,
“I’ve overstepped the bounds of what’s skillful.” is is why training in virtue is a
good exercise for observing your mind in action.
e precepts also apply the distinction between skillful and unskillful to all of
our actions. When you know something is against a precept, you realize, “I may
want to do this, but if I look at it from a more objective perspective, it’s unskillful.
It’ll cause long-term suﬀering, so I’ll stop.”
In practicing the precepts, we’re also exercising what right view tells us about
our freedom to choose our actions. For instance, you may be tempted to say or do
something wrong, but you realize, “I’m free to say no.” And in exercising that
freedom, you develop something of value in yourself.
I’ll give you an example from the monks’ precepts. One of the precepts for the
monks is that if someone comes and asks a monk where something should be
given, the monk should say, “Give where you feel inspired or where you feel it
would be well used.” Several years ago, I had a student whose mother was going to
give a gi of two million dollars to a Buddhist center. He called me up and asked,
“What can I tell her so that she’ll give the money to the monastery?” I said, “Tell
her to give where she feels inspired and where she feels it would be well used.” So,
she gave it to another organization. I told myself, “I now have a precept that’s
worth more than two million dollars.”
So, you have to remember that your virtue is something of value and it lies in
exercising your freedom to say no to something that might be tempting. Notice



82

here that freedom is not an issue of simply being free to do what you want to do.
It means being free to do what you know will lead to good long-term results.
ese, then, are some of the lessons of right view that are taught with the
practice of virtue.
As for the perfection of truth, remember, last night we talked about truth as a
quality of the person. When you decide that you’re going to stick with these
training rules in all situations with no exceptions, you’re putting your long-term
well-being ahead of short-term unskillful pleasures. When you can stick with this
decision, day in and day out, you develop your truth as a person.
As for the perfection of goodwill, virtue is an expression of goodwill for others
and for yourself. In terms of others, as the Buddha said, if you hold to the
precepts in all situations, you’re giving universal safety to all beings. Now, this
doesn’t mean that you’re protecting them from all dangers. Instead, it means that
no one anywhere will be subject to these dangers coming from you. When you
give this kind of universal safety to others, you have a share in universal safety
yourself. Another way in which the precepts are helpful to others is that if you
take on a precept, it’s not just that you decide that you’re not going to break the
precepts. It also means that you’re not going to tell anyone else to break the
precepts, and you’re not going to condone other people breaking the precepts. In
this way, you’re also protecting other people, in that you’re not getting them to do
something unskillful, which means that you’re not trying to persuade them to
take on bad kamma.
It’s interesting to note that, from the Buddha’s point of view, bene ting others
means getting them to follow the precepts, whereas bene ting yourself means
that you follow the precepts. e point here seems to be that we are agents,
choosing how we act, and that by getting others to follow the precepts, you show
respect for their role as agents and try to get them to exercise that role in a way
that will lead most directly to their long-term bene t. In the same way, when you
follow the precepts, you respect your role as an agent and try to exercise it
skillfully.
is means that you’re expressing goodwill for yourself as you follow the
precepts.
e Buddha says that the long-term bene ts of observing the precepts can be
experienced both in the present life and in future lives. If you conduct your life in
a virtuous way, your wealth tends to be more solid; you have a good reputation

83

for being a reliable person; if you go to a meeting of people, you can expect that
people won’t rightly accuse you of misbehavior; and you die unconfused. When
people approach death and recall ways in which they’ve been harmful in their
behavior, they tend to fall either into extreme sorrow or denial. is is actually
one of the reasons for dementia as people get older. ey don’t want to think
about the past, they don’t want to think about the future, and so their minds just
wander oﬀ.
Now, the Buddha does recognize there are times when following the precepts
can lead to certain kinds of losses in daily life, in terms of wealth, health or
relatives. Say, for instance, that you have a relative who wants you to lie in a court
case. In a situation like that, the Buddha would say not to lie, because loss in
terms of your relative is a minor issue, whereas loss of your virtue is a major one.
ere was an interesting story in the news a couple of years back. A young
Iranian man was murdered, and the murderer was caught and sentenced to death.
Apparently, in Islamic law, if the parents of someone who has been murdered are
still alive, they have the right to choose whether or not the death sentence will be
carried out. Originally, the parents were going to go for revenge. But then the
mother started having dreams in which the son came to her and said, “Please,
Mom, don’t go for revenge.” e mother did not want to have that dream, but it
kept coming back again and again.
So, on the day of the execution, the murderer is sitting there with a noose
around his neck. e mother goes up, she slaps him as hard as she can, takes oﬀ
the noose, and then walks away. A erwards, when she was interviewed, she said
she felt a tremendous and unexpected sense of peace and relief, so she was glad
she had listened to the dream.
ese examples show some of the bene ts in this lifetime of following the
precepts. ere are also bene ts in terms of future lifetimes. e Buddha says that
if you don’t kill, when you’re reborn you’ll tend to have a longer lifetime. If you
don’t steal, your things will tend not to be stolen. If you avoid illicit sex, you
won’t be subject to rivalry and revenge. If you don’t tell lies, people will tend not
to lie to you. And if you don’t take intoxicants—which include wine—then you
will tend not to be crazy in the next lifetime.
e Buddha didn’t go into further detail on that last point.
ese are some of the ways in which the practice of the precepts develops the
perfection of goodwill in your dealings with others—and with yourself.

As for the perfection of renunciation, following the precepts helps to develop
qualities of mind that you will need in the practice of concentration, which builds
on the practice of right mindfulness.
To begin with, following the precepts makes it easier to be mindful in general.
(And remember here that mindfulness means the ability to remember what was
done and said long ago, and to keep that memory in mind.) When you look back
and you see that you haven’t harmed anyone with your actions, it’s a lot easier for
your memory to go back further into the past, and then you can learn lessons
from the past much more easily. If you’ve been harming others and breaking the
precepts, the mind will tend to put up a wall so that you won’t remember that
harm, and that will get in the way of your mindfulness.
Also, as you’re practicing in line with the precepts, you’re developing your
mindfulness, alertness, and ardency, which are the three qualities that you need in
practicing right mindfulness and right concentration. In terms of mindfulness,
you have to remember that you’ve taken the precepts. is is o en a problem for
people who have just begun taking the precepts. ey start doing something and
say, “Whoops! I took a precept against that.” So, you have to keep these precepts
in mind.
Secondly, you have to be alert to what you’re doing.
Ardency is involved when, if it’s diﬃcult to follow the precept, you make the
extra eﬀort to make sure that you stick with it.
When I was new to taking the precepts, I happened to go back to my
childhood home to visit my relatives. We were staying in a cabin near the
seashore, and one a ernoon one of my cousins said, “You know, Grandpa used to
like to go clamming not far from here, and then he’d make clam chowder. Let’s go
clamming.” So, ve or six of us went out to go clamming. I was digging down in
the sand under some shallow water and I found a clam. As I started to pick it up, I
realized, “Whoops! I have a precept against doing this.” So, I put the clam back
down on the sand and went oﬀ someplace else, pretending to search for clams
elsewhere. In the meantime, one of my cousins went to the spot where I had been
and found the clam right on top of the sand and said, “Here’s a clam! We can take
it.” Another cousin said, “No, if the clam is on top of the sand, that means it’s
dead. Leave it.” So, I saved the clam’s life in spite of myself. at was a lesson in
how much more mindfulness and alertness I needed to develop.



85

Following the precepts also gives you practice in the kind of restraint you’re
going to need to get the mind into concentration and to keep it there. You’re
going to have to learn how to say no to yourself when distractions come into the
mind, and the precepts give you good practice in learning to say no to yourself
eﬀectively in daily life. As my teacher used to say, “If you can’t control your
mouth, there’s no way you can control your mind.”
e precepts, then, are good practice for the skills you’re going to need as you
develop mindfulness and concentration, which are directly connected to the
perfection of renunciation.
ey’re also a practice for further developing the perfection of discernment, in
that you have to use your ingenuity to stick to the precepts in ways that don’t lead
to unfortunate circumstances. For instance, if you take the precept against killing,
you have to gure out, “How am I going to arrange my house so that I don’t have
to kill pests? How do I live in such a way that I don’t attract termites? How do I
live in a way that I don’t attract ants? And if the ants do come in, how do I get rid
of them without killing them?” is develops your discernment. Similarly, if you
have some information that you know that some people might abuse, how do you
prevent that information from getting to them without lying? As you gure this
out, it’s good training in discernment.
In these ways, the practice of following the precepts is an expression of right
view, an expression of goodwill, and an expression of truth. It helps to develop the
perfections of renunciation and discernment.
And it gives rise to a sense of self-esteem that you’re able to live in a way that
causes no harm to anybody at all. I don’t know if this is an issue here, but in
America we have a problem where psychologists have been so insistent about the
need for children to learn self-esteem that children now receive in ated grades to
make them feel good, and teachers put gold stars on their papers, saying, “Rock
Star.” e result is that we now have plenty of people with high self-esteem but
with no substance to back it up. However, one of the ways to foster genuine self-
esteem backed up by real substance is through developing virtue. And this works
not only for children. It’s also important for adults, because we’re judged by so
many things in life that are out of our control and that have nothing to do with
the skillfulness of our choices, as when we’re judged by our beauty, our cleverness,
our wealth, or our social position. But if we can learn how to judge ourselves by
our virtue, our self-esteem can be based on the genuine skillfulness of our own


86

actions and our own choices.     is puts the power for our self-esteem and self-
respect into our hands.

QUESTIONS

Q: e presentations of generosity, virtue, and the precepts o en mention the
bene ts that will come to the person who is generous, to the person who is
virtuous, leading to the attainment of awakening. But it sounds like playing by
the principle of the ends justifying the means, even though here the means are
good for others. is seems to be a little bit sel sh. In the Jātakas, one sees the
future Buddha develop all of these qualities, but how does he develop generosity
and goodness without knowing that there would necessarily be any attainment of
awakening?
A: When the means are really good for yourself and for others, they don’t
need to be justi ed. Still, they require eﬀort, and if you’re going to stick with that
eﬀort, you have to see that it’s worthwhile. A good way of motivating yourself to
stick with the path of goodness is to remember that it will also lead to happiness.
One of the basic principles of Buddhism is that when you really do good, you
bene t and other people bene t as well. e practice of these virtues is designed
to make you see that, yes, there is a way that you can make other people happy
that makes you happy, too. In other words, as you help them, you’re helping
yourself; when you help yourself, you’re helping them. at’s the kind of
goodness and happiness you want to look for. Remember, the Buddha never asks
us to deny our desire for happiness. He simply points out how to nd happiness
in a way that’s wise and compassionate, both toward ourselves and toward others.
ere’s a sutta where the Buddha lists four kinds of people, and they go in this
descending order: the person who bene ts himself and bene ts others, the person
who bene ts himself but does not bene t others, one who bene ts others but
doesn’t bene t himself, and the person who doesn’t bene t either himself or
others. It’s interesting the way the way number 2 and number 3 are ranked. e
person who bene ts himself and not others is listed higher than the person who
bene ts others without bene ting himself. e basic principle is that if you don’t
know how to bene t yourself, you can’t really bene t others properly.
At the same time, it’s good to remember that if you’re not bene ting from
your practice, it’s going to be hard for you to continue with it. In the bodhisatta’s


87

case, he wasn’t sure about the correct path to follow, but he de nitely was looking
for results. at’s what his quest was all about: all the actions he did in the hope
that they would lead to a happiness that doesn’t age, grow ill, or die. Because you
can’t use that deathless happiness to arrive at a deathless happiness, you have to
practice with a clear sense of ends and means.

Q: Do the ve precepts belong to all the diﬀerent traditions of Buddhism?
And is their interpretation diﬀerent?
A: You nd them in all the Buddhist traditions, but there are some diﬀerences
in the interpretation. e major diﬀerence is that in some traditions, they say not
to break them at all, and in other traditions they say if you have a compassionate
motive, you can go ahead and break them. We belong to the tradition that says
not to break them.

Q: On the subject of the precept about lying: It doesn’t count as a lie if it
avoids useless suﬀering. Isn’t that right?
A: Any misrepresentation of the truth counts as a lie. Even if you do it for
what you think is a kind or sympathetic purpose, it still counts as a lie, and it still
breaks the precept. If you feel that a certain truth is going to cause suﬀering for
someone, you don’t misrepresent the truth. Instead, you try to change the subject.
If they’re really insistent and want to know, only then do you tell them. When I
teach in America and the topic of lying comes up, this issue always arises—that
there must be some conditions where it’s okay to lie. When I was teaching in
Massachusetts, the scenario given to me was, “What if I’m lling out my tax
forms?” In California, the question is, “What if your friend is wearing an ugly
dress and asks, ‘How do I look?’” But in both cases the answer is: You can’t lie.
When lling out the tax form, you ll out the tax form correctly. As for your
friend, you think to yourself, “ is dress is better than if she were naked. So, yes,
it’s ne.”

Q: What about social lies like Santa Claus? Do we break one of the precepts if
we spread them?
A: Yes. When I was four years old, I thought it would be nice to leave some
milk and cookies for Santa Claus, so I placed them on a plate on the mantle of the
replace in the house. e next morning, there was a note from Santa Claus,


88

thanking me for the cookies and milk, but it was in my mother’s handwriting,
which I recognized as hers. I don’t know whether I was more upset that there was
no Santa Claus or that my mother would lie to me. So, it’s best not to spread lies,
because when the little child nds out, he or she is going to feel betrayed.

Q: I have lots of problems around the rst precept. First of all, I have a hornet
hive in the roof of my house. My neighbors, who have a small daughter, want me
to have it destroyed. Is it necessary to save the life of the hornets and risk being
responsibility for the possible death of a little girl?
A: My experience has been that there are ways that you can remove nests like
this without killing the hornets. You have to look around to nd the people who
can do that. We had that problem with killer bees in our guesthouse at the
monastery. It took a while, but we were able to nd someone who was able to
remove the bees without killing them. So, taking a precept like this means that
you have to go a little bit more out of your way to nd ways of solving the
problems without breaking the precept.

Q: Second question: What about the uses of antibiotics?
A: e precept against killing covers only things that you can see with the
naked eye. ings that are too small to be seen don’t count under the precept.
ere are medicines allowed in the Vinaya that do have an antibiotic eﬀect. As for
parasites in the body that are large enough to see, there are medicines that allow
them to come out of the body without killing the parasite. Basically, they make
the parasite faint. When it faints, it lets go and comes out of the body.

Q: e next question is: What about abortion?
A: In the Buddha’s time, abortion was legal. He didn’t campaign to make it
illegal, but he didn’t condone it. So, as part of observing the precept, you would
not commit an abortion, and you would not advise other people to have an
abortion.

Q: What about this precept of not killing in relationship to mosquitoes that
carry dengue and zika, etc.?
A: I’m always amazed at how few places in Brazil have screens on their
windows. Because no matter how many mosquitoes you kill, more will come. It’s


89

like those horror movies: You know—you kill one zombie, and then a hundred
zombies come in its place. In ailand, they tried to get rid of mosquitoes with an
eradication program, and they discovered that the mosquitoes quickly developed
a resistance to the insecticide. So, the best way to deal with this type of problem is
to realize that we have to live in a world with mosquitoes and do our best to
protect ourselves from them by creating safe spaces, for example, by putting
screens on windows and nding mosquito repellents that will drive the
mosquitoes away without killing them.
I speak of these issues with experience. I’ve had malaria twice, but I still say:
Don’t kill mosquitoes.

Q: e precept against killing is o en translated into adopting a vegetarian
diet. Is this necessary? Aren’t you also killing these poor vegetables, stripping their
skin oﬀ while they’re still alive and boiling them?
A: For the monks, our rule is that we’re not allowed to eat meat if we either
know or suspect that it was killed for the purpose of feeding us. e precept
against killing is speci cally against either killing something on your own or
telling someone else to kill. Now, if you want to take the precept further and
adopt a vegetarian diet, that’s perfectly ne. But the precept doesn’t require it.
Just make sure that when you go to a seafood restaurant and they have a sh tank
with live sh, don’t choose any of the live sh.
As for vegetables, they don’t come under the concept of sentient being—they
don’t feel pain—so the precept doesn’t cover them.
We’ve received several questions on the issue of the relationship between the
rst precept and a vegetarian or non-vegetarian diet. You have to remember that
the precept is a training rule. It’s not a principle for trying to create a perfect
society or a perfect world. Its purpose is to focus you on the things that you are
directly responsible for doing.
Also, it doesn’t guarantee that, if you abide by the precept, you’re not going to
have any bad kamma. In other words, the precept is phrased in such a way that
eating meat does not go against the precept, but you still have the kamma of
eating the esh of the animal that had to die for that.
is is one of the reasons why monks have a re ection every day on the food
they eat, which is that they’re incurring a debt and only through the practice can
they get beyond that debt. You take the time to re ect on the fact that simply

90

having a body requires that you place a burden on many other beings, which gives
you a good motivation for trying to nd a happiness that doesn’t need to feed.
One of Ajaan Lee’s re ections is that when you’re about to die, the spirits of all
the animals whose bodies you ate are going to come thronging around, asking for
some merit. If you don’t have any merit to give them, they’ll take you with them.
But if you have lots of merit to dedicate to them, they’ll be happy to take your
merit instead.

Q: You said that eating meat does not break the precept against killing. How
can you say that the consumer of the meat does not play any role in supporting
the killing of the cow? How can this not be breaking the precept?
A: It’s not the case that eating meat does not support the killing of the cow. It
does play a role in supporting that, but the precepts cover only two things: One is
what you do yourself, and the other is what you give the order to do. at’s all
that’s covered by any of the precepts. Beyond that, if you feel inspired not to
support the cow-killing industry, then don’t eat meat. But that goes beyond the
precept. We’re not trying to create an ideal society with the precepts. We’re trying
to focus directly on what we’re doing so that our own personal behavior is
conducive to getting the mind into concentration and then gaining the insight so
that we don’t have to come back to this process that needs to keep on eating.
Only when you train the mind to the point where it doesn’t need to feed can it
can be really pure.

Q: We had a long question from a mother with a 14-year-old child who
wanted to be a vegetarian. e child did not like the fact that his mother was not
a vegetarian and was giving her many, many, many reasons for becoming
vegetarian. No matter how she would argue with him, he wouldn’t listen to her
reasoning. She wanted to know how I would reason with the kid.
A: I would basically say, “If you’re providing the food for the family, then you
have the right to have a say in what kind of food is being xed. Until you reach
that point, the mother is the one making the decisions.”

Q: From the point of view of kamma and the precepts, what should we think
about euthanasia, putting an end to the suﬀering of a domestic animal, rather
than prolonging life unreasonably?


91

A: ere is no need to prolong life unreasonably in order to stick by the
precept. is means that it’s not against the precept to pull the plug on a life-
extension machine. If the body cannot survive on its own, its death is not an act
of killing.
However, euthanasia would be against the precept. Most of our feelings
around euthanasia come from the belief that the animal has only one life and if it
dies, then it’s not going to suﬀer a er death. From the Buddhist point of view,
though, the animal a er death will go on to another life, and you have no idea
how much suﬀering there’s going to be in that next life. What you do know is
whether or not you’ve made the choice to kill the animal. So, from the point of
view of the precepts, the best thing is to give the animal some painkiller and try to
keep it in as pain-free a condition as possible. Let nature take its course.

Q: Second question: If someone who’s close to me is sick and asks me to
accompany him or her to Switzerland or Belgium to have an assisted suicide,
would it be a breaking of the precepts?
A: It wouldn’t be a breaking of the precepts, but still it’s taking a person to a
place where you know he or she is going to be killed. So, it would be best to let
your friend know your feelings about the whole issue. If the friend still wants you
to go, you could still go and not break the precepts. However, in the time of the
Buddha, there were people who actually did assisted suicide, where they would
hire someone to stab them to death. According to the monastic code, having
someone else do that is even worse kamma than simply committing suicide
yourself because you’re getting that person to take on the bad kamma of having
killed you.

Q: Is there a diﬀerence in kamma between a person who dies from a natural
death such as a heart attack, etc., or a person who commits suicide?
A: Dying of a natural cause is the result of past kamma, whereas a suicide is
based on a decision you make now. When you’re dying a natural death, you’re
simply receiving the results of past kamma, whereas if you commit suicide, you’re
creating new bad kamma.

Q: e next question: Is there a diﬀerence between the kamma of someone
who commits suicide due to an event in life such as a disappointment in love or


92

the loss of a job, as opposed to someone who commits suicide when suﬀering
from a mental depression or anxiety?
A: It’s hard to measure the karmic consequences of a particular act, because in
each case they’re going to depend on many other actions in that person’s life. I
have a friend who is a psychic. All her life, she’s had to deal with a lot of spirits of
people who’ve passed away. And in every case of a suicide, she says, there’s always
what she called the “Oh shit!” moment, with a lot of regret. So, whenever
possible, if you can discourage someone from committing suicide, you’ve done
that person a big favor.

Q: Why do the precepts ask us not to watch shows?
A: is is only for the eight precepts, which are basically the ve precepts
augmented with the factor of sense restraint. For example, when you don’t watch
shows, that’s putting a little more restraint over your eyes. Not listening to music
puts some restraint on your ears. Not wearing perfumes and garlands puts some
restraint on your nose. Not eating a er noon puts some restraint on your tongue.
And not lying down on luxurious beds puts some restraint on your body. Most
people take these precepts only occasionally. Traditionally, in eravāda countries
—and this is a tradition that goes back to the Pāli Canon—some people choose
to take the eight precepts on the uposatha days. ese days correspond to the full
moon, new moon, and half moons. Taking these days oﬀ to practice the eight
precepts and listen to the Dhamma provides a good context for practicing
meditation.

Q: Re ecting on the fact that suﬀering comes from internal causes in the
mind makes me re ect on the fact that not all professions are conducive to
developing mindfulness and virtue. Please clarify.
A: ere is such a thing as wrong livelihood: a livelihood based on breaking
the precepts, a livelihood based on developing unskillful qualities in your own
mind or one in which you’re trying to give rise to unskillful qualities in the minds
of others. So, if you realize that your livelihood is wrong livelihood, it might be a
good idea to change if you can. ere was a cartoon in the magazine e New
Yorker in the United States where two men were carrying a corpse, and the corpse
had its feet stuck in cement—in other words, these were criminals taking a corpse



93

to throw into the river. And one of the men is saying, “I wish there were another
way to make a living.” ere are other ways.

Q: In the readings on virtue, there’s a sutta, Aṅguttara Nikāya 8:40, which
talks about the kamma generated by certain kinds of actions. What happens if the
mind changes and no longer does that kind of action? Will it still have to be
responsible for the opposite kamma that was generated in the past?
A: e results of past kamma will be there, but—assuming that the past
kamma was bad—the good kamma of changing your mind and changing your
behavior will then compensate. Be patient when unfortunate kamma does bear
fruit, and remember that the important factor is your state of mind right now. As
you keep the mind developing unlimited goodwill, as you train it to not be
overcome by pleasure or pain, that, in and of itself, will make the results of past
bad kamma weaker, and will keep you from creating any bad new kamma right
now.

Q: I’m a sinner. I know I will go to hell because of my past actions. Every day I
try to live with my precepts, and I’m proud of this, but in my dreams and
nightmares, the bad things I did in the past come to mind, and I’m very regretful
about it. How can I let this feeling go away so I die without confusion? Should I
go to everyone I hurt and ask for forgiveness?
A: It’s important to realize that just because you’ve broken the precepts does
not mean you’re going to go to hell. As the Buddha said, if you realize that you’ve
been doing wrong and you make up your mind not to repeat that mistake again
and you hold to the precepts, that good kamma can protect you from going to
hell. He added that the right response when you learn about the precepts and you
realize that you did break the precepts in the past is to tell yourself, “Okay, that
was a mistake. at was not a good thing to do, but if I have remorse or regret for
that, the remorse will not go back and erase the mistake.” e proper course is to
make up your mind that you’ll restrain yourself in the future and to spread
thoughts of goodwill: goodwill for the people whom you’ve harmed, goodwill for
yourself, and then goodwill for all beings. So, the next time you have bad dreams
in which you feel feelings of regret or remorse, when you wake up, spread
thoughts of goodwill to everybody involved in the dream and then goodwill for
yourself.


94

Now, while you’re in the course of dying, it’s as if diﬀerent doorways open up
to you. If there’s one door that goes to hell, don’t tell yourself, “I am a sinner. I’ll
have to go to hell,” because that thought will take you through that door. Keep
reminding yourself of the good you’ve done ever since you started taking the
precepts, and keep telling yourself, “I do not have to go to hell.” at will help you
to go through a better door.
As for asking forgiveness of others: Try to put yourself in their place. If you
think they would appreciate the fact that you now realize the harm you did to
them, and it would calm their mind to hear your apology, then go ask forgiveness.
But if you think that seeing you again would simply disturb them, and that they’d
rather you stayed out of their lives, then leave them alone. Spread lots of goodwill
in their direction, and leave it at that.

Q: I want to prepare for the moment of my death so that I won’t go to a bad
destination. How do I prepare so that I don’t believe the committee member in
my mind who says that I’m a bad person?
A: One of the reasons why we meditate is so that we’ll be alert at the moment
of death. en remember that any voice that comes into the mind is just one
member of the committee, and as a meditator, you should have learned not to
believe everything that every member of the committee says. is is one of the
reasons why one of the meditation topics is re ection on your own virtue and
your own generosity, so that you get skilled at recalling these things when you
need them.

EVENING

Persistence
Last night we talked about how the desire to put an eﬀort into the practice
comes from meeting a reliable teacher and deciding that the Dhamma the teacher
teaches makes sense. But the desire to practice comes from more than that. e
Canon tells the story of one of the Buddha’s relatives who died. e Buddha said
that if that person had put an eﬀort into the practice when he was young, he
would have become fully awakened. If he had put an eﬀort into the practice when



95

he was middle-aged, he would have reached a lower level of awakening. If he’d put
an eﬀort into the practice when he was old, he would have reached the rst stage
of awakening. But he never put an eﬀort into the practice at all, and so he missed
out on the opportunity to gain awakening in this life.
at’s a chilling story. It should give rise to the desire that you don’t want to
miss out on what can be attained through human eﬀort. at desire is what lies at
the basis of the perfection of persistence, which is our topic for tonight.
e Pāli word for persistence, viriya, can also mean “energy” and “eﬀort.” It’s
identical with right eﬀort in the noble eightfold path. As the Buddha explains,
right eﬀort works closely with right view and right mindfulness. Right view tells
you what is skillful and what’s not. Right mindfulness helps you remember the
lessons of right view. Right eﬀort is what actually puts those lessons into practice,
so as to abandon the wrong factors of the path and to develop the right factors in
their place. So tonight, I’d like to look into the diﬀerent ways in which
discernment, or right view, and right mindfulness work to develop the perfection
of persistence.
Persistence is directed by discernment in four ways:
• e rst way is seeing the distinction between what is skillful and what’s
unskillful.
• e second way is giving you the motivation to want to put forth eﬀort to
abandon what’s unskillful and to develop what’s skillful.
• e third is teaching you the diﬀerent types of eﬀort that can be skillful.
• And the fourth concerns the amount of eﬀort that is skillful.
So let’s look at each of these four.
e rst one doesn’t require much explanation, because we’ve already been
talking a lot about what’s skillful and what’s unskillful. Unskillful qualities are
those that lead you to do harm. Skillful qualities are those that help you to avoid
doing harm.
e second way in which discernment guides your persistence, though,
requires more explanation. at’s in providing motivation. ere are many
diﬀerent ways in which you can motivate yourself to want to practice. e
Buddha says that the primary motivation underlying all skillful activity is
heedfulness, in which you see the dangers that come from not acting in skillful
ways and the bene ts that can come from acting in skillful ways. For example, you


96

focus on the drawbacks of ordinary sensual pleasures as a way of motivating
yourself to want to nd a non-sensual happiness, such as the happiness in
concentration, which is higher and more secure.
All the other ways of motivating yourself to practice derive from heedfulness.
For example, you can motivate yourself to practice through developing
compassion. is is based on heedfulness because you realize that by practicing,
you will bene t, and people around you will bene t, too. A er all, the less greed,
aversion, and delusion you have in your mind, then the less you’ll suﬀer from
them and also the less other people will be in icted by them as well.
Another way of motivating yourself is to try to develop a sense of humor
around your de lements. If you can see them as ridiculous, it’s easier to give them
up. is is based on heedfulness because a healthy sense of humor comes from
stepping back and looking at something objectively, seeing where it’s incongruous
and doesn’t make sense. Heedfulness is what inspires you to step back.
Most people miss the examples of humor in the Canon, largely because they’re
most prominent in the Vinaya, which is the section concerning the rules that the
monks have to follow, and very few laypeople read that section. Each rule has an
origin story to explain the reasons why that rule was formulated, and o en those
stories contain an element of humor.
I think this is interesting because, rst, it helps you see how ridiculous the
mistake would be if you broke the rule, and that helps to distance you from any
desire within yourself to break the rule. at’s the objective viewpoint that comes
from stepping back from your de lements. Second, it’s a lot easier to live by a
system of rules if you can see that the people who formulated the rules had a good
sense of humor. It helps you appreciate that the rules are not grim, punitive, or
dull.
For example, one of the origin stories concerns a monk with psychic powers
who has defeated a re-breathing serpent. e laypeople hear about this and want
to make merit with him. So, they ask the monks, “What is it that monks usually
don’t receive on alms rounds?” However, they ask the wrong monks. e monks
say, “We never get any hard liquor.” So, the next morning, everybody in the city
has prepared a glass of hard liquor for the monk who defeated the re-breathing
serpent. He drinks the liquor at house a er house a er house, and then passes out
at the city gate.



97

e Buddha comes along with a group of monks and sees the monk lying
there, so he has the monks take him back to the monastery. ey lay him down
on the ground with his head toward the Buddha. Now, he doesn’t know where he
is, he tosses and turns, and he ends up with his feet pointed straight at the
Buddha, which in India is a sign of great disrespect. e Buddha asks the monks,
“In the past, didn’t this monk show respect to me?” “Yes.” “Is he showing respect
now?” “No.” “And didn’t he do battle with the re-breathing serpent?” “Yes.”
“Could he do battle with a salamander now?” “No.” is is why the monks have a
rule against drinking liquor.
So, that’s another way of motivating yourself to want to do what is skillful: by
using your sense of humor to see how ridiculous your de lements are.
Another way of motivating yourself is to take inspiration from the examples of
the Buddha and the great teachers, because they expand your idea of what human
beings can do. ere’s a story in the Canon where a monk is out in the wilderness
and he’s ill. He asks himself, “Am I going to try to go back to the city to nd a
doctor?” en he thinks of the example of the Buddha and the great noble
disciples who treated their diseases by developing the factors for awakening and
the ve faculties, and he decides, “I’ll try that, too. I’ll stay on in the wilderness.”
Another way of motivating yourself is by cultivating healthy versions of what
the early texts call craving and conceit. In other words, you think, “Other people
can gain awakening. I’d like that, too.” at’s healthy craving. “ ey’re human
beings, I’m a human being. ey can do it, so why can’t I?” at’s healthy conceit.
Even though you eventually have to abandon craving and conceit, there are stages
in the path where you need to use healthy versions of them to convince yourself
that the goal is worth pursuing and that you’re capable of attaining it.
ere are even some instances when the Buddha recommends some fairly
unskillful motivations to get yourself to do something skillful. For example, when
it’s very diﬃcult to have goodwill for someone you’re angry at, you can remind
yourself that if you acted on your anger, you’d probably do something very stupid,
and that would please your enemy. Do you want to give pleasure to your enemy?
It’s not a very skillful thought—it’s actually quite spiteful—but it can prevent
some unskillful behavior. And it, too, is based on heedfulness: the desire to use a
lesser unskillful state to avoid a more damaging unskillful state.
I know in my own case, when I was a monk in ailand, I came to realize that
some people there view Western monks like dancing elephants. e simple fact


98

that they can dance is enough. ey don’t think they’re going to dance well. In
the same way, there were people who would say, “ ese Westerners, can they
really understand the Dhamma?” So, I said to myself, “I’ll show them.” Which
may not be the most skillful thought, but it got me to meditate a lot more.
Now, you’ll notice that all of these forms of motivation require a healthy sense
of self. is is a point that has to be underlined many times. We hear so much
about the teaching on not-self that we tend to forget that the Buddha said we
should try to make the self its own mainstay. You do that by developing a healthy
sense of self: that you’re responsible, you’re capable, and you will bene t from
developing skillful actions. is also requires a resilient sense of self that’s willing
to admit mistakes and learn from them.
ere’s a medical university in the United States that has, as one of its
specialties, brain surgery. Of course, everyone who applies to a brain surgery
school will have good grades, but not everybody with good grades would make a
good brain surgeon. So, the administrators at the university tried to nd a way of
asking questions during the interview that would help weed out the people who
would not make good surgeons. ey found two questions to be especially
helpful in this area. e rst was, “Can you tell us of a mistake you made
recently?” If the candidate said, “No, I can’t think of any mistakes I’ve made
recently,” the candidate would be rejected. e second question: “If you had to do
it again, how would you do it diﬀerently?” If the candidate hadn’t thought of how
to do it diﬀerently, again the candidate would be rejected. What you’re looking
for in a good brain surgeon is someone who recognizes mistakes and thinks about
how not to repeat those mistakes. is requires a sense of self that’s very solid,
that’s not threatened by admitting mistakes and doesn’t try to deny mistakes. is
is precisely the kind of healthy sense of self you need as you practice, to motivate
yourself to develop the path even further.
In fact, you want to be proud that you can learn from mistakes. is relates to
another one of the teachings that the Buddha gave to his son. He said, “Before
you meditate, try to make your mind like earth. People throw disgusting things
on the earth, but the earth doesn’t react.” e Buddha says the same thing about
wind, re, and water. Wind can blow disgusting things around, but the wind
doesn’t get disgusted by them. Water can be used to wash dirty things away, but
the water doesn’t get upset. Fire burns things that are disgusting, but the re isn’t
disgusted by them. In the same way, you need to have a solid attitude toward


99

looking at your past mistakes. When you can admit them and not be shaken by
them, you put yourself in a position where you can learn from them.
ese, then, are some of the ways in which discernment gives guidance in how
to motivate yourself to put forth eﬀort.
As for the types of skillful eﬀort, there are basically four: e rst is to prevent
unskillful qualities from arising, the second is to abandon unskillful qualities that
have arisen, the third is to develop skillful qualities that have not yet arisen, and
the fourth is to develop and maintain skillful qualities that have already arisen.
Now, it’s important that we notice that there are four diﬀerent kinds of right
eﬀort. All too o en we hear that there’s just one, which is letting go, letting go,
letting go. But there are a lot of things that you should not let go of, or that you
should develop rst before you can let them go later. For example, when
concentration arises, you don’t just let it go and think that you’ve gained insight
into the impermanence of your concentration. When concentration arises, you
should try to maintain it and develop it further. at’s when you’re engaging in
right eﬀort.
Now, of these four diﬀerent kinds of eﬀort, the one that gets discussed least is
the act of preventing, so that’s what I’d like to focus on tonight.
One way of preventing unskillful qualities from arising is by exercising
restraint over your senses. In other words, when you’re looking at or listening to
something, ask yourself why. What purpose do you have? Or you might ask
another question: “Which member of the mind’s committee is in charge of the
looking or the listening?” Only if one of the skillful members is in charge should
you continue looking or listening. For example, you’re walking down the street.
You see something that you’d really like to have, and you’re looking at it in a way
that aggravates your greed. You have to ask yourself, “Do I really need this?” And
if you realize that you don’t really need it, then you should look at the object in a
way that helps to undercut your greed.
Nowadays, most of our problems with sense restraint don’t happen so much
while we’re walking down the street. ey happen when we turn on the computer
or we look at our phone. You have to remind yourself: ese things do not turn
themselves on. You’re turning them on and you have to ask yourself why. If you’re
not really clear, don’t turn them on. You can prevent a lot of unskillful mind
states that way.



100

Another way of preventing unskillful qualities from arising is by
contemplating what the Buddha calls your requisites. We live in dependence on
four requisites: food, clothing, shelter, and medicine. Each time you use these
things or think of getting new ones, you have to realize they have a proper
purpose, which is to help you develop skillful qualities of the mind. If you’re
going to use them in ways that give rise to unskillful qualities, you’re misusing
them. So, it’s good to re ect on these requisites with these questions in mind each
time you use them. at will undercut a lot of unskillful behavior. For example,
when you go out to get something to eat, remind yourself that you eat simply to
keep the body alive and healthy. Anything beyond that is a waste of your
resources, which could be put to better purposes, and you’re placing unnecessary
burdens on other people. So, it’s good to re ect on these things on a daily basis.
Another way of preventing unskillful qualities from arising is, at the end of
your meditation every morning, to think about what you expect to happen
during the day. If you anticipate any situations in which you might do or say
something unskillful, ask yourself, “How could I prepare for that situation so that
I don’t do anything unskillful?” Run a few scenarios through your mind until you
can think of a skillful way to avoid doing or saying something unskillful, even
when the people around you do or say things that would ordinarily provoke you.
All too o en, we emphasize the present moment in our meditation and forget
that we can use the meditation to prepare for the future—and that’s a perfectly
legitimate way of using our meditation.
ose are some thoughts on the diﬀerent types of eﬀort.
As for the amount of eﬀort, you try to nd an eﬀort that’s just right, and this
is going to depend on two factors: One is the task at hand, and the other is the
amount of energy you have.
In terms of the task at hand, the Buddha said the causes of suﬀering in the
mind come in two forms. Some of them will go away easily if you simply look at
them. ese are cases where you should look at them with equanimity. ere are
other causes for suﬀering in the mind, though, that when you look at them, they
stare right back. ey don’t go away easily. ey have no sense of shame. is, the
Buddha said, is the time when you have to “exert a fabrication.” Remember what
the three kinds of fabrication are: You learn to breathe in a diﬀerent way, you
learn to talk to yourself in a diﬀerent way, and you bring new perceptions to the
issue. is requires that you can take apart your unskillful state, analyzing it into


101

the three types of fabrication, and then use skillful versions of those three
fabrications to create something skillful in its place.
So, those are cases where the amount of eﬀort that is just right will depend on
the task at hand.
e second issue is the amount of energy that you have. ere’s a story in the
Canon of a young man, gently brought up, whose feet were so tender that they
had hair growing on their soles. e story is quite long, but eventually this young
man ordained as a monk. One night, he was doing walking meditation, and it was
so hard on his feet that they started bleeding. Feeling discouraged, he sat down
and thought, “Maybe I should disrobe. I could still make merit as a layperson.”
Well, the Buddha was on top of Vulture Peak, and so he disappeared from
Vulture Peak and appeared right in front of the monk. He said, “Were you
thinking of disrobing just now?” Can you imagine? You’re sitting and meditating,
and you’re thinking, “I might as well give up,” and all of a sudden, the Buddha
appears in front of you. So, the young monk said, “Yes, I was.”
e Buddha asked him, “When you were a layperson, were you skilled at
playing the lute?” e monk said, “Yes.” e Buddha said, “When you tuned the
strings of the lute so they were too tight, did it sound good?” “No.” “And when
they were too loose, did they sound good?” “No.” “How about if they were tuned
just right? Did the lute sound good then?” “Yes.” en the Buddha concluded,
“In the same way, when you’re practicing meditation, you tune your eﬀort to the
level of energy you have, and then you tune the rest of your ve faculties—your
conviction, mindfulness, concentration, and discernment—to that, and then your
practice will go well.”
In the same way, as you’re meditating at home—it’s been a long day, you’re
tired, all you can think about is wanting to sleep—that’s not the time to say, “I
will not get up from my meditation until I’ve achieved full awakening.” You tell
yourself, “Okay, I’ll sit and meditate for the hour”—or however long you’ve
determined—“and try not to fall asleep.” However, on other days when you do
have more energy and you’ve set the timer for half an hour, if the alarm sounds
and you still have energy, give yourself another half-hour.
at’s determining how much eﬀort is just right based on how much energy
you have.




102

So, these are the four diﬀerent ways in which discernment gives guidance to
your eﬀort and persistence:
• in pointing out what’s skillful and what’s not,
• in giving you ideas for how to motivate yourself,
• in pointing out the diﬀerent types of eﬀort that are appropriate, and
• in determining the amount of eﬀort that’s just right.
For your persistence to be right, it’s best guided by right view as to what issues
in life are important and what qualities in mind will keep you on track.
Remember, right eﬀort focuses on skillful and unskillful qualities in the mind,
and as your discernment points out, the mind is the most important factor in
your life. So, that’s where you have to focus your right eﬀorts. Discernment also
teaches you how to determine which eﬀorts are right for attaining the goal.
Now, right mindfulness remembers these lessons and it keeps you alert so that
you can apply them at all times. In this way, you’ve got mindfulness working
together with discernment. Now, it’s interesting to note that in ai, the words
for mindfulness and discernment, sati and paññā, when you put them together—
sati-paññā—form a compound that means “intelligence.” And here we’re talking
about the kind of intelligence in which you’re alert to what needs to be done, you
have presence of mind to remember what should be done, and you use your
knowledge to good eﬀect. True intelligence requires more than just mindfulness
and discernment. It also requires eﬀort. In other words, if you learn something
but then don’t try to remember it, that’s not really intelligent. If you learn and
remember but don’t try to put it into action, that’s not very intelligent either. It’s
when you try to learn, try to remember, and try to put into action what you’ve
learned: at’s when you’re really using your intelligence. And that’s when your
eﬀorts, your persistence, become the perfection of persistence.

QUESTIONS

Q: How can I meditate to overcome laziness in daily life?
A: Ajaan Maha Boowa once said his least favorite question was, “What’s an
easy way to overcome laziness?” You have to remind yourself that if you want
anything good out of life, you have to put in eﬀort. ink of the bad things that
happen to lazy people, the things they miss out on, and then think of all the good



103

things that come from putting in eﬀort. en the question is “What is the
appropriate eﬀort for this task I have right now?”

Q: Why do we feed on the vicious cycle of not doing what we know is good
for us?
A: ere’s part of the mind that doesn’t really believe that what is good for
you really is good for you. You have to nd which part of the mind that is and ask
it, “Why? What’s the allure of being lazy?”

Q: I have a lot of psychological defects, including laziness, ill will, and
attachment to material things. What can I do to ght this?
A: With ill will, consciously try to develop thoughts of goodwill, and the
members of the committee that like ill will will start to complain. en you can
get in a dialogue with them. Ask them, “Why do you like ill will? What do you
get out of it? It’s miserable food for the mind.” As for attachment to material
things, make a practice of giving things away. Here again, part of the mind will
complain, and then you can get into a dialogue with it. As for laziness, give
yourself little rewards for being more energetic, and a er a while your energy will
develop momentum.

Q: If any unskillful thought arises and you acknowledge it as unskillful, does
it still have negative kammic eﬀects?
A: No.

Q: In other words, does the arising of unskillful thoughts cause bad kamma or
is it just our reaction to them?
A: It’s our reaction to them that can cause bad kamma. e fact that the
thought arises is the result of old kamma. What you do with it is your new
kamma. If you simply acknowledge it and it goes away, or if you think skillful
thoughts that counteract it and make it go away, then the new kamma is good
new kamma.

DAY SIX
MORNING

Mindfulness
Last night we talked brie y about the role of mindfulness in developing
persistence. is morning, I’d like to discuss that point in a little more detail
because there’s a lot of misunderstanding around the topic of mindfulness.
We o en hear that mindfulness is an accepting and non-reactive state of mind,
that it’s very closely related to equanimity. But actually, in the way the Buddha
teaches mindfulness—as a faculty of memory—mindfulness is purposeful. You
keep certain things in mind because you have a purpose—the purpose being to
protect your behavior and your state of mind from being unskillful. As the
Buddha said, when mindfulness is in charge, its purpose is that if there’s any
skillful behavior in thought, word, or deed that you haven’t yet mastered, you’re
mindful—i.e., you keep remembering—to try to master it. If you have mastered
it, you try to protect it, maintain it, and bring it to full development. In other
words, instead of simply watching skillful qualities come and go, you keep
remembering to try to make them come and to prevent them from going. at’s
the role of right mindfulness.
e Buddha frequently talks of the practice of mindfulness as a kind of
protection and refuge, and he uses a variety of analogies to illustrate the various
kinds of protection that mindfulness provides.
First, it keeps you in bounds. To illustrate this role, the Buddha gives the
analogy of a quail. Normally, quails live in elds that have been plowed, with
stones turned up. But one day a quail wanders away from its territory. A hawk
swoops down and carries it oﬀ, and the quail laments, “Oh, my lack of merit! If
only I had stayed in my ancestral territory, this hawk would have been no match
for me!” e hawk hears this and is irritated by this upstart quail, so it says, “But
where is your ancestral territory?” And the quail says, “A plowed eld where
stones have been turned up.”
e hawk lets the quail go: “Go. Go to your territory, but even there you still
won’t escape me.” So, the quail utters down to the eld, stands on top of a stone,


105

and starts taunting the hawk, “Come, get me, you hawk! Come, get me, you
hawk!” e hawk swoops down again, and as soon as the quail sees that the hawk
is coming at him full speed, he slips behind the stone. e hawk shatters his
breast there on the stone and dies.
e Buddha says the eld here stands for the establishing of mindfulness,
whereas the area outside of the eld stands for thoughts of sensuality. e hawk
stands for your de lements. If your thoughts don’t stay in bounds, then your
de lements can get you. is is one of the things that mindfulness does: It keeps
your thoughts in bounds. You remember what is skillful, you remember what is
not skillful, you remember that you’re safe only when you stay within what is
skillful, so you remember to do whatever is needed to keep your thoughts within
safe bounds.
Another image the Buddha used to make the same point is that of a
gatekeeper at the gate of a fortress. e fortress is located at the frontier of a
country, and there’s always the danger that enemy spies may try to get into the
fortress. So, the gatekeeper has to recognize who’s a friend and who’s not, and to
keep out those who are not friends. Now, if mindfulness were simply acceptance,
the gatekeeper would just stay there at the side of the gate, noting who came in
and who went out. If a spy came in, it would simply say, “Oh, there’s a spy.” Now,
some spies, when they’re recognized, might run away, but a lot of spies would just
walk on into the fortress. e point of this analogy is that mindfulness has to be
very active in recognizing what’s not skillful and in keeping it out. is is another
analogy to illustrate the role mindfulness plays in keeping your thoughts within
bounds.
e second way in which mindfulness protects you is to keep you focused on
what’s important. It reminds you that the most important thing that you have
right now is the state of your mind, and if any unskillful thought comes in, your
rst priority is to get it out. e Buddha illustrates this point with an analogy of a
man whose head is on re. His mindfulness is focused on putting the re out
right away. He doesn’t simply watch the ames and note their pretty colors; he
remembers that he’s got to put them out, and he can’t let anything else distract
him. at’s the second way in which mindfulness helps protect your mind: It
keeps your priorities in mind and keeps you focused on your task.
e third way is that it keeps reminding you always to stay observant, to learn
from your actions what works and what doesn’t work. In other words, it doesn’t


106

just keep you in bounds. It also reminds you that your best protection is
knowledge, and the best way to gain knowledge is to learn from your own
actions. is relates to that point we made earlier: that the Buddha looked for
two qualities in a student—one, that the student be honest about what he has
done and two, that he be observant about what the results are. ese two
qualities underlie this role of mindfulness.
e Buddha illustrates this point with the simile of a cook. e cook works
for a prince, and he has to notice what kinds of food the prince likes to eat.
Sometimes the prince will say what he likes, but sometimes he won’t. But if the
cook is observant, he notices what the prince likes to reach for. He’ll make more
of that kind of food, and in that way he’ll get rewarded. In the same way, you have
to learn how to be observant as to what helps your mind gain concentration and
other skillful states—in other words, what ways of meditating the mind likes and
that give good results—and you also have to remember the lessons you’ve learned,
so that you can apply them each time you meditate. at’s how your meditation
becomes a skill you can rely on. And that’s one of the ways in which mindfulness
provides a refuge.
ese, then, are some of the ways in which mindfulness gives you protection
as you go through life making choices. Because remember: We don’t live in a
deterministic world where all our actions are pre-determined. We do have a range
in the present moment for choosing what to do and what not to do, remembering
that the suﬀering that weighs most on the mind is the suﬀering that comes from
our own choices. is is why it’s so important to know about the diﬀerent ways in
which we fabricate our experience of the present moment—by the way we
breathe, by the way we talk to ourselves, and by the perceptions and feelings we
focus on and hold in mind—because they’ll play a big role in leading us to suﬀer
or not to suﬀer. Remember that you do have the ability within you to make a
diﬀerence in whether you’re going to suﬀer or not, and you can be more in charge
of how you conduct yourself on the path.
Now, this doesn’t mean that there’s no room for equanimity and acceptance in
the practice. Most of the ai ajaans noticed that for Westerners, our biggest
weakness is that we don’t really understand equanimity and acceptance. e main
point that we don’t understand is that these mental qualities are skills and that we
have to be selective in using them: when to apply equanimity and when not,
when to be accepting and when not. If unskillful states are taking over your mind,


107

you can’t be equanimous about them. You can’t simply accept them. You have to
do what you can to get rid of them. As for other issues in life, you have to see
where you can make a diﬀerence and where you can’t, and also evaluate where it’s
worth the eﬀort to try to make a diﬀerence and where it’s not.
e Buddha o en compares a person who’s practicing the Dhamma to a
warrior. Like any good warrior, we have to choose our battles, realizing that we
don’t have the energy to solve every problem in life. at means we need to apply
our main energy to solving the problems within our own minds. e most
important thing for us to accept is responsibility for our own suﬀering. is is the
main lesson of the four noble truths. It is possible for us to make a diﬀerence for
the better, and the question we should always be asking ourselves is, “What is the
most skillful thing to do now?” We meditate to make the answer to this question
more and more clear, and then when we’ve learned what’s skillful, we meditate
further in order to give ourselves strength to carry through with what we’ve
learned.

QUESTIONS

Q: What is the diﬀerence between mindfulness and concentration?
A: Mindfulness practice as the Buddha described it is actually how you get the
mind into concentration. In other words, you stay focused on the body in and of
itself—ardent, alert, and mindful—and you put aside any distractions with
regard to the world. at’s the description of mindfulness. When you succeed in
doing it well, you bring the mind into concentration.

Q: Are mindfulness and vipassanā the same thing?
A: No. Mindfulness is the act of keeping something in mind. Vipassanā is
insight, a quality of seeing the fabrications of the mind clearly, so clearly that you
develop dispassion for them. Now, mindfulness is one of the practices that can
lead to clear insight, but clear insight also requires concentration and right view.
ere’s one passage where the Buddha says that for the mind to develop
concentration, you need insight and tranquility, and to develop tranquility and
insight, you need to develop concentration. e image is of two hands washing
each other. e le hand cleans the right hand, the right hand cleans the le
hand, and that way both get cleaned.


108

Q: You’ve said that mindfulness is to always keep something in mind. I
thought that mindfulness was to be aware of the present moment, but if I’m
keeping something in mind, I might not be aware of the present moment. I get a
little confused. Could you say more about it?
A: ere is mindfulness and there is right mindfulness. Mindfulness in
general means keeping something in mind. Right mindfulness means
remembering which qualities are skillful, which ones are unskillful, and
remembering to be alert and ardent about recognizing and developing skillful
qualities in the present moment.

EVENING

Giving
Tonight, we start with the perfections that come under the heading of
relinquishment. ere are two of them: giving and renunciation. Tonight’s talk is
on giving, which covers not only giving material things, but also giving your time,
giving your energy, giving your knowledge, giving your forgiveness.
ere are many motivations for giving, but giving becomes a perfection when
your motivation to do it focuses on the value of generosity in training the mind.
You’re using material things, your energy, and your knowledge for the bene t of
your mind. Ajaan Lee makes a comparison. He says it’s like squeezing the juice
out of a fruit. e juice is the virtue of generosity; the rind that’s le is the object
you give away.
is is a lesson in trading up through letting go. As you practice generosity,
you realize that there is a hierarchy in pleasures. In particular, you increase your
happiness by sharing with others. When you enjoy sensual pleasures, they may be
pleasant while they’re there, but the pleasures soon pass. And a erwards, when a
pleasure is gone, the memory of that pleasure is not always pleasant, especially if
you had to do something unskillful to get it, or when you think about the fact
that you used to have that pleasure but now it’s gone and may not return in this
lifetime. However, with generosity, if it’s done skillfully, you’re happy before you
give the gi , you’re happy while giving the gi , and the memory a er giving the




109

gi is also happy. As you see how happiness increases by sharing it with others,
that drives home the lesson that Dhamma practice is cooperative.
As the Buddha taught the monks, they have to depend on one another when
they’re sick, and they have to depend on laypeople for their material support. In
turn, the laypeople depend on the monks. A er all, laypeople can rarely devote
themselves full-time to the Dhamma, but the monks do have the time to devote
themselves fully to the practice, which means that they have knowledge to share.
is exchange is an economy of gi s. ere’s no price for teaching the Dhamma,
and the laypeople are not forced to give gi s. Both sides give voluntarily, and this
helps to break down barriers. If you have to pay for something, that puts up a
barrier. But when no payment is required, the barrier is removed.
e act of generosity is also a lesson in delayed grati cation. is is an
important lesson underlying the entire practice. We had a question about ends
and means the other day, and that’s what the path is: means to a good end, an end
that may take a long time to attain. If you learn the lessons of delayed grati cation
early on—that you can take pleasure in the fact that you’re on a good path to an
even better destination—it will help see you through many fallow stretches of the
practice.
Many years back, they conducted an experiment with a group of children.
ey took each child and put him in a room. On the table in front of him was a
doughnut. ey told him, “We’ll come back in ve minutes. If you haven’t eaten
the doughnut, we’ll give you a second doughnut.” en they le the child alone
in the room. ey were secretly taking a video of the children while they were
doing this. e videos showed that some of the children were able not to eat the
doughnut; some of them ate the doughnut immediately; others would play with
the doughnut, nibbling it away slowly; some of them would bite underneath it
and put it back on the table to hide what they had done. en they did a follow-
up study for many years until the children were adults. ey found that the
children who were able to refrain from eating the doughnut did much better in
life generally than the others. e lesson is that if you learn the lesson of delayed
grati cation early, it establishes good habits throughout life.
e act of generosity is also a solid way of building self-esteem. ere was
another study about children, this time centered on the issue of doing chores.
ey found that in many advanced societies, the parents no longer have their
children do chores. Both parents work, they’re in a hurry to get the house in


110

order, they don’t have the time or patience to teach the children how to do chores
properly, so they send the children oﬀ to look at their iPads or play video games.
Whereas in traditional societies, if a child wants to do a chore, the parents will
encourage it, even if it takes a fair amount of time for the child to get it right.
And they’ve found that the children who do chores when they’re young grow up
with more self-esteem.
So, when you realize the lessons that can be learned with generosity and you
practice generosity as a way to train your mind, this is how generosity becomes a
perfection.
Now, as I said, the act of giving doesn’t cover just material things. It can also
include the gi of your time, the gi of your strength, the gi of your knowledge,
the gi of forgiveness, or the gi of the Dhamma itself.
One of the most impressive instances of generosity that I’ve experienced was
when we built a chedi, a spired monument to the Buddha, at Ajaan Fuang’s
monastery in ailand. His students wanted to build a chedi, and they tried to
hire people to do it, but the people they hired worked for a week and then ran
away. e students then decided to build the chedi themselves. For a year and a
half, they would come almost every weekend. ey would leave Bangkok on
Friday evenings, right a er work, arrive at the monastery at midnight on Friday,
work most of the day Saturday, usually with a cement-pouring Saturday night, do
some more work on Sunday a ernoon, and then drive back to Bangkok early
Monday morning and go straight to their jobs.
Now, very few of these people were wealthy, and few of them had any
construction experience, so they had to learn a lot of new skills. But they happily
gave a lot of their time and their energy, and they learned many of the bene ts of
generosity in the course of doing so. In particular, there was a very strong sense of
family among the people who worked together, even though they came from
many backgrounds and many levels of society. And they appreciated the fact that
Ajaan Fuang had given them the opportunity to do this. So, generosity is not just
the giving of material things. It’s giving what you have, and then this becomes the
basis for all other practices in the path.
When Ajaan Suwat was teaching meditation in the United States, a er the
second or third day of the retreat, he turned to me and said, “Do you notice how
grim all these meditators are?” His analysis was that they hadn’t rst learned the
joys of generosity and virtue. When you learn the joy of giving, it gives you a


111

sense of con dence in the teachings, that you’re able to bene t from practicing
them. You realize that if you want to get anything of lasting value out of life, you
have to be willing to give up some of what you’ve already got. When you learn the
joy that comes from that lesson, it spreads to the joy of virtue and the joy of
meditation.
Now, for generosity to become a perfection, it has to be guided by right view,
in particular, in relationship to kamma. And here’s where we learn what’s
speci cally Buddhist about the Buddhist culture of giving.
e rst point is that generosity must be done voluntarily. King Pasenadi once
came to ask the Buddha, “Where should a gi be given?” He probably expected
the Buddha to say, “Give to the Buddhists,” or, “Give to Dhamma teachers.”
Because if he asked the Brahmans, the Brahmans would say, “Give to the
Brahmans.” If he asked the Jains, the Jains would say, “Give to the Jains.” But the
Buddha said something very diﬀerent. He said, “Give where you feel inspired or
where you feel the gi would be well used.” In other words, there are no “shoulds”
as to where you should give a gi . at’s why, when the monks are asked, “Where
should I give a gi ?” they are supposed to answer, “Give where you feel inspired,
or where you feel the gi would be well used or well cared for.”
We’ve already had a couple of questions about generosity that we haven’t
answered until now. One question is, “Should we give to beggars?” One woman
asked if she should give to her daughter, because she was afraid her daughter was
becoming too dependent on her. But here again, the answer is, “Give where you
feel inspired.” In the Buddhist culture of giving, giving is our rst lesson in free
will: the realization that we have freedom of choice. is is probably the most
important lesson you can learn about kamma. And the Buddha wants us to
protect that lesson. at’s why people should never be pressured to give—for
instance, saying that, as a good Buddhist, you have to give to this or that cause.
Giving should always be voluntary.
You might carry out a mental experiment yourself. ink back to the rst gi
that you gave voluntarily—not because it was someone’s birthday, not because the
gi was expected, but simply because you wanted to give. at was your rst
lesson in free will. So, the rst lesson we learn from right view about generosity is
that it has to be voluntary.
King Pasenadi went on to ask another question of the Buddha, “When a gi is
given, where does it give the best result?” is time, the Buddha replied, “ at’s a


112

diﬀerent question.” is is where we begin to approach generosity not simply as
an expression of free will, but as a skill. And generosity as a skill has four
dimensions.
• e rst has to do with your motivation in giving.
• e second concerns your attitude while you are giving.
• e third has to do with who are the best recipients of gi s.
• And then the fourth concerns what kind of gi is good to give.
Let’s look at these four dimensions.
First, with regard to motivation: e lowest motivation the Buddha mentions
is when you give a gi because you expect to get something similar back,
sometimes with interest. When I was a monk, newly ordained, there was a nun I
knew who had decided to build a hut for some of the monks at Wat Asokaram,
Ajaan Lee’s monastery. She sponsored the construction and also directed the
workers. One day, I visited the construction site as she was directing the work,
and although the hut was small, it was very well built. I asked her, “Are you
building your palace for your next life?” She replied, “No, this is my vacation
home. I’ve already built my palace at a temple in Bangkok.” at may not be the
highest motivation, but it’s better than not giving.
A higher motivation, the Buddha said, is the idea that it’s good to give. An
even higher motivation is that “I have these things, these other people don’t have
these things, it’s not right that I don’t share.” A motivation higher than that is
when you realize that giving a gi makes your mind serene and happy. And
ultimately, you give not because you’re expecting anything from the gi at all. It’s
simply an expression of the goodness of the mind: at’s the gi of a non-
returner. So, to get the most out of the gi , you try to develop increasingly higher
motivations.
e second dimension in giving as a skill is your attitude while you give. You
give attentively, you give with conviction that something good will come of this,
you give with empathy for the person who’s receiving the gi , and you’re not
simply throwing it away. In other words, you appreciate the opportunity to give a
gi , like Ajaan Fuang’s students appreciating the opportunity to give their time
and energy to building the chedi. You sense that you’ll bene t from the gi , and
you show respect to the person to whom you’re giving the gi . at makes the
recipient glad to receive it and more inclined to use it well.



113

As for the third dimension—the best people to give a gi to—the Buddha
said that it’s best to give to those who are free of passion, aversion, and delusion,
or to those who are practicing to overcome passion, aversion, and delusion,
because these are the people who are most likely to make best use of the gi .
When you re ect back on the gi , you’ll be happy that you gave.
And nally, as to the gi that’s good to give, the Buddha said that you give in
season. In other words, you give a gi that’s appropriate for the time. For example,
you don’t give winter clothes in the summer. Also, you give without adversely
aﬀecting yourself or others. In other words, you don’t give so much that you don’t
have enough to use yourself, and you don’t steal the gi to give it to somebody
else.
Now, as for the results that come from giving, the Buddha says that people
will nd you charming, they’ll admire you, you’ll have a good reputation, and
you’ll approach assemblies of people without being ashamed. ese are bene ts in
the present life. One of the bene ts not mentioned in the texts is that this is the
perfection that allows you the most room for creativity. ere are not many
creative ways of observing the precepts or of meditating, but you can be as
creative as you like in deciding what to give, in trying to nd something that will
give joy to the recipient and that will be especially appropriate for the occasion.
ere’s a lot of joy that comes from being creative in this way. ese are the results
you gain in the present life.
In the future life, you’ll tend to have a good rebirth. ere’s a passage where
the Buddha says that no matter what level you’re born in, you’ll tend to be good-
looking within that level. For example, if you’re reborn as a dog, you will be a
good-looking dog. And that’s nothing to sneer at.
Years back, the late king of ailand decided that he didn’t like the idea that
ai people were so enamored of buying foreign dogs to raise, so he wanted to
promote ai breeds of dogs instead. Now, there’s a belief in ailand that really
smart dogs will be born with what look like socks on their feet. In other words, if
the dog is brown, the paws and bottom parts of its legs are white. So, the king
gave an order: If any puppies with socks on their feet were born anywhere on
royal or government properties, he would raise them in the palace. And so quite a
few dogs born on the side of the road ended up living in the palace. One of them
was so smart and well-behaved that the king actually wrote a book in her honor.
ese are some of the future-life rewards of being generous.


114

As we learn the culture of generosity, it’s important to realize that, in addition
to not pressuring other people to give, we should also be gracious in receiving
gi s from other people. I don’t know if this is a problem in Brazil, but many
American people are very embarrassed about receiving gi s. ey’ll say, “Oh, you
shouldn’t have done that!” at attitude, of course, doesn’t encourage generosity.
Whereas the Buddhist culture does encourage generosity, which is why it’s
important to be gracious when you receive a gi .
Now, as I said earlier, generosity forms the basis for other practices on the
path. ere’s a passage where the Buddha says that stingy people can’t get into
good concentration, and they can’t reach the higher attainments. is is probably
because they don’t appreciate the cooperative nature of the practice, and they also
don’t appreciate the principle that you trade up as you give away. You take
material objects, your energy, your knowledge, your time, and then you turn them
into good qualities of the mind. Only when you appreciate that principle will
your practice progress.

QUESTIONS

Q: On giving, could you explain in more detail “an ornament for the mind,”
passage [§30]. By giving in this way, does one become a non-returner?
A: It’s not that by giving with this motivation you become a non-returner.
Basically, this passage describes the motivation of someone who already is a non-
returner. Someone who’s not coming back to the world can still give gi s to the
world without any anticipation of returning to enjoy the results of that gi . at
kind of giving is the purest kind. In fact, this was the gi that the Buddha gave to
the world when he taught a er his awakening. He knew he was going to leave,
but he decided to leave something good behind for the people who were going to
come a er. at was the ornament of his mind.

Q: You talked about the highest motivation of giving. I’m not sure precisely
what you said, but I was le with the paraphrase that it’s the natural expression of
the mind? Sounds like Buddha nature. anks.
A: Generosity is a natural expression of the mind only a er the mind has
reached the level of non-returner. Prior to that time, there always will be some
expectation of a return on a gi . e return will get more and more re ned as


115

your motivation goes up. But only a er the stage of non-returning is the mind
totally free of any sense of having anything back in return. So, it’s not Buddha
nature.

Q: Of the two highest motivations for generosity, calming the mind and
generosity as an ornament of the mind, what is the diﬀerence?
A: e highest motivation, as I said just now, is the motivation of a person
who already is awakened to at least the level of non-return. at person doesn’t
need to have his or her mind calm through generosity, because it’s already calm.
As long as you need to have your mind calmed, stick with the second highest
motivation.

Q: e next question is: Is the highest motivation so strong that it can
actually lead to non-return?
A: And the answer is No. It’s the result of having reached the state of non-
return.

Q: Is it wrong to be generous knowing that it’s good kamma? I don’t want to
bargain with the Dhamma.
A: e highest motivation for generosity, in which you don’t expect anything
in return, applies only to a person who is at the third stage of awakening. Up until
that point, we need something to motivate us in order to give: the thought that,
“Yes, we will bene t from this.” So, knowing that it’s good kamma is actually good
motivation to foster.

Q: You said that a stingy person cannot enter into concentration. What if that
person does become generous? Would he or she be able to enter into
concentration in this lifetime?
A: Yes.

Q: We’ve talked about generosity. What about charity? Why don’t Buddhists
support charitable organizations for people in need, as other religions do?
A: Traditionally, every monastery functioned as a charitable organization. If a
child was orphaned, it would be taken into the monastery and raised by the
monks or nuns. If a man or a woman lost a spouse, he or she could ordain. Either


116

that or they could live as lay attendants at the monastery. I know of some
monasteries where they always keep a couple of huts empty in case a husband and
wife in the village get into a big argument and need a place to go to get away from
each other for a while. e point is that the monasteries have long been
functioning as charitable organizations on a grass-roots level—local people
helping local people. Also, the monasteries in Asian countries have functioned as
one of the few ways in which people of a low social position could advance to a
high social position. Many of the Supreme Patriarchs of ailand, for instance,
have been the sons of peasants.

Q: Is it skillful to give alms to anyone who asks for them?
A: Give to anyone you feel inspired to give to. If you don’t feel inspired, it’s
perfectly okay not to give.

Q: So as not to excite pride and envy, should acts of generosity be done
discreetly? ere’s the teaching of the Buddha that criticizes people who are not
ashamed of things that are worthy of shame and are ashamed of things that are
not worthy of shame.
A: You have to look at the situation. e Buddha said, of course, that
generosity is nothing to be ashamed of, and sometimes it’s good to be open with
your acts of generosity so as to be a good example to other people. But if there are
people who become jealous about your generosity, that might be a time to be
more discreet.

DAY SEVEN
MORNING

Sel es & Not-self
e other night, I mentioned how a healthy sense of self is essential for
motivating yourself in the practice. We then got a lot of questions on the issue of
not-self, so I’d like to talk about that topic this morning.
One of the biggest misunderstandings about Buddhism is the belief that the
Buddha taught that there is no self. Actually, the existence or non-existence of the
self was an issue he refused to get involved with. He had a policy that there were
certain questions he would not answer, and one of the questions he wouldn’t
answer was, “Do I have a self ? Do I have no self ?” He said that if you held to the
position either that you had a self or that you had no self, you would get involved
in a tangle of views that would get in the way of awakening. So, he would put that
question aside.
What he did talk about was the process he called “I-making” or “my-making”
by which you create a sense of self. ere are also times when we deny that
something is us or ours. He saw both of these processes—self-making and not-
self-making—as actions. And the question about actions always is, are they
skillful or not? In other words, when is creating a sense of self a skillful action,
and when is it more skillful to say that something is not your self ? What ways of
creating a self are skillful, and what ways are not? What ways of saying “not-self ”
are skillful and what ways are not?
In both cases, the concepts of self and not-self are perceptions, and we use
both of these perceptions as strategies to nd happiness.
For example, with the perception of self, when you have a desire and you want
to bring the desire about, you create two senses of self. e rst is the self as the
consumer, the you that will enjoy the results of getting that desire ful lled. en
there’s the self as the producer, the self that will actually be able to bring that thing
about. For example, if you have a desire for a vegan pizza, the self as the consumer
is your sense of your self as the person who will enjoy eating vegan pizza. e
sense of self as the producer is the self who has the skills and means to bring this


118

about, either the self who has the money to buy the pizza or the self who has the
ability to get the ingredients to make the pizza.
Now, this applies to all kinds of desires, both skillful and unskillful. Even to
practice the path, you also need both senses of self. For example, Ven. Ānanda,
who was one of the Buddha’s foremost disciples, said that you need to have a
healthy sense of self as a producer. He expressed it in this way: You think of the
fact that there are other people who have gained awakening. “ ey are human
beings, I’m a human being. ey can do it, why can’t I?” at’s a healthy sense of
self as a producer on the path, the self that feels capable of following the path.
As for the self as a consumer, the Buddha recommends that when you’re
getting discouraged in the practice, you should remind yourself that you got on
the path because you wanted to nd a way to the end of suﬀering. You loved
yourself. If you give up on the practice, does that mean you don’t love yourself
anymore? is is a healthy sense of self as a consumer on the path.
As we go through life, we create many diﬀerent selves around our diﬀerent
desires because we see that they’re helpful in bringing about whatever it is we
want. It’s in this way that they’re strategies, strategies for happiness.
e same principle applies to not-self. You see that there are certain things
that are not worth desiring or certain ideas or certain habits that are getting in the
way of your desires, and you decide that you’re not going to identify with them
anymore.
Now, as we go through life ordinarily, we tend to adopt these diﬀerent
strategies of self and not-self without thinking too much about them. For
example, think back to when you were a child. If some children down the street
were beating up on your little sister, you’d think, “ is is my sister. I have to go
defend her.” But when you got her safely back home and she started playing with
your toys, she wasn’t your sister anymore. She was the Other.
We apply these diﬀerent perceptions pretty unconsciously as we go through
life, but when we come to the practice, the Buddha asks us to be more systematic
in applying them for the sake of putting an end to suﬀering. For example, when
you’re practicing the precepts, there may be some things that would pull you away
from practicing the precepts. Suppose that someone were to oﬀer you some
money to lie: You’d have to remind yourself, “ at money is not really mine. e
things that I could buy with that money would leave me a er a while.” So, you
apply the perception of self to your precepts, and a perception of not-self to the


119

money and the things you would buy with the money you’d gain from lying. at
helps you to stick with your precepts.
Similarly, when you’re practicing concentration, the object of the
concentration is yours, and the person meditating is you. As for any distracting
thoughts that would come up, that’s when you think about how the perceptions
and thought fabrications in that distracting thought are not-self. It’s in this way
that you learn how to apply these perceptions of self and not-self more
systematically, so that both the strategy of self and the strategy of not-self actually
are conducive to a genuine happiness.
It’s only when you’ve fully developed all the factors of the path that you let go
of everything, because you’ve found a happiness that doesn’t require any strategies
anymore, and the only way to fully experience that happiness is to let go of
everything. You don’t identify with perceptions of self, and at that point, even the
perception of not-self is something you don’t identify with, either. You have to let
that go as well. at’s the way you can nd the ultimate happiness.
So, to understand the teaching on not-self, we have to view it within the
context of the teaching on kamma. is is the opposite of what many people
usually do. ey make the teaching on not-self the context, interpreting it as
saying there is no self, and then they say, “Well, how does the teaching on kamma
t into that?” And it doesn’t t very well, because it seems like the Buddha is
saying there is no agent deciding how to act, and there’s no one being aﬀected by
the action, so why should kamma matter?
e Buddha, however, took the issue the other way around. He started with
the principle that there are skillful and unskillful actions, and some skillful
actions can be so skillful that they can take you all the way to nibbāna. e
question of self as an activity and not-self as an activity ts into that context very
well. You use perceptions of self and perceptions of not-self when they’re helpful
for the path. In that way, they enable you to follow this path, which the Buddha
called the kamma that leads to the end of kamma. en, when you reach the end
of kamma, you also reach the end of the perceptions of self and not-self. All that’s
le is the ultimate happiness. And as Ajaan Suwat used to say, once you’ve found
that ultimate happiness, you’re not interested in asking whether there is or is not a
self experiencing it. e experience is there, with no need for strategies to attain
or maintain it, and it’s totally satisfying.

QUESTIONS

Q: Could you explain the diﬀerences between: 1) identity-view, sakkāya-
diṭṭhi, 2) self, attā, and 3) conceit, māna? A person who has right view has
abandoned personality view, self, and conceit.
A: is issue could be an entire talk, but to be brief: Sakkāya-diṭṭhi, or
identity-view, is basically when you tell yourself, “I am this.” And “this” may be
the body, feelings, perceptions, mental fabrications, or consciousness—or what it
is that has these things, something that lies inside these things, or something that
contains these things within itself. Any of these views would count as identity-
view. e crucial element is that there is the thought in the mind, “I am the same
thing as this.” e same goes for self. However, māna, which is translated in
English as “conceit,” is the thought, “I am,” or “I exist,” with no “this.”
e texts say that, as you attain the diﬀerent levels of awakening, at the very
rst level you abandon identity-view, in other words, any thoughts of: “I am this.”
However, conceit or māna is abandoned only on the last level of awakening, and
that’s because in the meantime you still have to train yourself in concentration
and discernment. e work of developing those trainings will require a sense of
“I”—just a sense that there’s an “I.” A er all, to develop concentration and to
develop discernment, you need to have a sense of “I am responsible for doing this.
I am doing this.” ere’s a sutta, Saṁyutta Nikāya 22:89, where a non-returner
explains that he still has a sense of “I am,” but it’s not identi ed with any of the
aggregates. He compares it to the scent of soap lingering in a piece of cloth a er
the soap has been used to wash the cloth.
So, when you develop right view at the rst level of awakening, you abandon
identity-view—the “I am this”—but there will still be a sense of “I am.” Only a er
full awakening will there be no need for any sense of “I.” But even a er
awakening, arahants still know who they are as opposed to who somebody else is.
For example, when they’re eating, they know which mouth to put their food in.
But their attitude toward that sense of “I” is very diﬀerent from ours.

Q: It’s said that we should not identify with events or phenomena, so when I
spread thoughts of goodwill, to individuals or to myself, or to an event in the
past, etc., if I say, “May my loving-kindness be bene cial to all beings,” wouldn’t it
be better to just say, “May loving-kindness be bene cial to all beings”? When I


121

speak of this energy of loving-kindness, I’m talking about the internal energy that
can be called goodwill.
A: is is one area where you actually have to take responsibility for your
goodwill. Anything connected with kamma is an area where you have to
remember that you need to be responsible. So, here you do want to identify with
the wish, because you have to remember to keep giving rise to this wish. It’s not a
universal force or innate nature that will come through you on its own. Ajaan
Suwat used to comment several times that there were many, many things that the
Buddha said are not-self, but still the area of kamma is one area where he said,
“ is is yours, and you will be the inheritor of the actions.” So basically, the
actions are yours. is is one of the areas where you have to take responsibility
and develop a healthy sense of self. On this topic, you might want to read the
book, Sel es & Not-self. It discusses the role of a skillful sense of self in furthering
your practice.

EVENING

Renunciation
Renunciation is the second of the perfections coming under the heading of
relinquishment. As with all of the other perfections, it’s based on desire. e
desire here is to get beyond the back-and-forth between pain and sensual
pleasure, pain and sensual pleasure, where sensual pleasure is your only alternative
to pain. As you know, for most people, the main pleasures in life are the sensual
pleasures: pleasures of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, tactile sensations. But these
are also very closely aligned to pain. Ajaan Chah has a nice image. He says that
pain and sensual pleasure are like a snake. One end of the snake has teeth: at
represents pain. e other end does not have teeth: at represents sensual
pleasure. We think it’s okay to catch hold of the end that doesn’t have teeth
because it’s not going to bite us, right? But we don’t notice that the end with
teeth is connected to the end that we’re catching, which is why we keep getting
bitten.
e Canon provides a similar image in one of its descriptions of hell. As in any
description of hell, there’s lots of suﬀering, but this particular hell is the one that



122

has always impressed me the most. It’s an immense iron box—iron walls, an iron
ceiling, and an iron oor. All the iron is glowing hot, so hot that the ames from
one side reach all the way to the other side. And all the beings in that hell are
there in the box. Every now and then, a door opens in one of the walls, so the
beings of hell run through the re to get to the door. As soon as they get to the
door, it slams shut. And then another door opens on another side, and so they go
running to that door, and as soon as they get there, it slams shut. is goes on for
quite a while. Finally, another door opens, they go running to it, and as soon as
they go through, they fall into the hell of excrement. One of the most sadistic
hells I know of.
But it’s also a good image for human life. We suﬀer from pain, and we see no
other alternative to pain aside from sensual pleasure. When we see the possibility
of a sensual pleasure that would give us some respite from pain, we go running for
it. If we can’t get it, we see another sensual pleasure we’d like, and we go running
for that, but we can’t get that one, either. Finally, there’s a pleasure we go running
for, we attain it, and then it becomes a big disappointment. Either that or, in our
desperation to get out of pain at any cost, we run for a sensual pleasure that
requires us to behave in unskillful ways that will lead to pain in the future.
at’s the kind of back-and-forth between sensual pleasure and pain that we
would like to escape. e Buddha says that there is an alternative pleasure that
can get us out of this back-and-forth, and that’s the pleasure of concentration. As
he said, this pleasure is blameless in the sense that it doesn’t harm anyone and
doesn’t intoxicate the mind. Sensual pleasures are a form of intoxication, but this
type of pleasure is not.
One of the rst requisites for getting the mind into concentration is that you
contemplate the drawbacks of sensuality. In the Buddha’s terminology, sensuality
is not the same thing as sensual pleasures themselves. It’s our fascination with
fantasizing about sensual pleasures and planning them. So, as a preliminary to
getting into concentration, think about the drawbacks of this fascination. To
begin with, it makes you dependent on things being a certain way. When they’re
not that way, you suﬀer. is puts you in a position of dependence and weakness.
e Buddha provides many images to depict the drawbacks of sensuality. One
is a dog chewing on a bone. ere’s no nourishment in the bone, and the only
avor the dog gets from it is the taste of its own saliva. In other words, as we’re



123

thinking about sensual pleasures, the pleasure we get is solely from the way we
elaborate on our vision of that pleasure, but there’s no real nourishment there.
Another image the Buddha gives is of a hawk ying oﬀ with a piece of meat in
its talons, while other crows and hawks are coming a er it to get the piece of
meat. In other words, sensuality makes your happiness depend on things that
other people are going to want to take from you, and they may injure you in the
process.
Another image the Buddha gives is of a man who’s borrowed some jewelry and
other ornaments from some friends and goes around showing them oﬀ. e
original owners see what he’s doing and they take their things back. In other
words, sensual pleasures o en depend on something that other people can give
you, but then they can take it back at any time.
ese are some of the ways in which the Buddha illustrates the drawbacks of
sensuality.
Now, the Buddha doesn’t say that all sensual pleasures are bad. Basically, he
says you have to look at (1) what the pleasure requires you to do to attain it and
(2) the eﬀect that a particular pleasure has on the mind. If it requires you to break
a precept to obtain it, or if indulging in it increases your passion, aversion, and
delusion, then it’s a pleasure to be avoided. But if it doesn’t require that you break
the precepts and it doesn’t give rise to unskillful states in the mind, then it’s okay.
In terms of the impact that the pleasure has on the mind, there are certain
sensual pleasures that the Buddha said are okay across the board. ese include
the pleasures of going out in nature, the pleasures of having a basic level of health,
the pleasures of living in a group that’s harmonious. But in other cases, it’s really
going to be up to you as an individual which sensual pleasures give rise to
unskillful states and which ones don’t.
However, he also says that even if you see the drawbacks of sensuality but you
don’t have the pleasure that comes from concentration, then you’re going to go
back to the old sensual pleasures anyhow—or to ones that are even worse. You’ll
stay stuck in the back-and-forth, running away from pain toward sensual
pleasures that then turn into further pain, perpetuating the cycle.
So, an important aspect of renunciation is not simply that you give up
sensuality, but that you provide the mind with an alternative pleasure. at
pleasure, as I said, is the pleasure of concentration.


124

Here I’d like to make a few remarks about concentration practice. We’ve had a
number of people saying they want to get into this or that jhāna, and it’s
important to remember that when you’re meditating, jhāna is not the topic of
meditation. e topic is the breath. In other words, while you’re meditating, you
shouldn’t be thinking of jhāna. You should be thinking about and focusing your
attention totally on the breath.
e Buddha identi es the themes of concentration as the four establishings of
mindfulness, which are the processes of getting the mind to stay solidly, say, with
the body or with feelings or mind states or dhammas—in and of themselves. For
example, if you’re focusing on the breath, you’re with the sensation of the breath
as it is right here, right now. at’s an instance of body in and of itself.
e Buddha describes four levels of jhāna, but it’s good not to worry about
them while you’re practicing. It’s better to re ect on them a er you’ve come out
of meditation. en, of course, the problem comes, “How do I know what level of
jhāna I was on?”
ere are some descriptions in the Canon that can give you an idea. For
example, in the rst jhāna, you drop any interest in sensuality and focus your full
attention on the breath. You think about the breath and you evaluate how well
the mind is staying with the breath and how comfortable the breath is. ere’s a
sense of well-being and even a sense of rapture that comes from the fact that
you’re free from being burdened by sensual thoughts. You let that sense of well-
being and rapture spread throughout the body.
Now, as the breath becomes more and more comfortable, and the sense of
well-being has spread through the body, you don’t have to keep thinking and
evaluating it anymore. You can simply zero in on the sensation of the breath, to
the point where your awareness and the breath seem to be one, and the breath
surrounds you on all sides. at would be the second jhāna. ere’s still a sense of
pleasure and rapture, more intense than before, and you let that spread through
the body on its own.
But a er a while, the sense of rapture begins to seem unpleasant. You want
something that’s more still and more re ned. You notice that there’s a more subtle
level of energy in the body. It’s like turning your radio on. You hit a station of
hard rock and you say, “Oh, that’s a little bit too much for me now. I want
something more calming.” So, to get a calmer station, you don’t have to move the
radio, you just change the setting. In the same way, you tune in to a more re ned


125

level of energy right at the spot where you’ve been focused. In that way, you get
into the third jhāna, in which the body has a sense of pleasure, and the mind a
sense of equanimity.
As you stay on that level, the breath becomes more and more re ned until the
in-and-out breath seems to stop moving. ere’s a sense that the breath energy in
the body is the source of the breath, and there’s no need to get any breath energy
from the outside. e breath energies in the body are now so well-connected that
they nourish one another. And there’s a very strong sense of being fully aware
throughout the body, along with a sense of stillness throughout the body. at’s
the fourth jhāna.
e Buddha gives some analogies for each of these jhānas. For the rst jhāna,
the image is of a bathman. In those days, they didn’t have bars of soap. ey had a
soap powder that they would mix with a little bit of water and make into a kind
of dough, like the dough for bread. In the image for the rst jhāna, the bathman is
working the water into the dough, making sure that all of the dough is moistened
with the water. is, of course, is symbolic for the work of your directed thought
and evaluation as they work the pleasure through the body to ll the entire body.
e image for the second jhāna is a lake with a spring near the bottom of the
lake. e spring has very cool water, and the cool water is coming up through the
lake, cooling the entire lake. is is a symbol for the sense of pleasure and rapture
lling the body without your having to do anything.
e image for the third jhāna is a still pool of open water with lotuses growing
in the water that haven’t come up above the water, so they’re totally saturated
with the still, cool water from their roots to their tips. is is a symbol for the still
sense of pleasure, minus the rapture, lling the body.
e image for the fourth jhāna is of a man sitting covered with a white cloth,
and there’s no part of the body that’s not covered by the white cloth. e cloth
here stands for awareness lling the body.
In all these images, water stands for pleasure, and movement stands for
rapture. e image for the rst jhāna is the only one with a conscious agent doing
any activity: at stands for directed thought and evaluation. In that image, the
movement consists of the bathman’s actions for working the water through the
soap dough. In the second image, the water ows of its own accord through the
lake, whereas in the third image the water is still. In the fourth image, there’s no
water and no movement.


126

ese are the images the Buddha uses to illustrate what it feels like to be in
these diﬀerent levels of jhāna.
Now, you still have the question: Which of these levels am I in? My teacher,
Ajaan Fuang, when he taught meditation, would give every new student Ajaan
Lee’s book on the steps of breath meditation. At the end of the book, there are
instructions about how to use breath meditation to get into the four jhānas. But
Ajaan Fuang never told his students which jhāna they were in. He’d simply ask
them, “What does your breath feel like?” In other words, he wanted them to
focus on the actual sensation of the concentration and not to worry about how to
label it as this or that jhāna. As you were focusing on that direct sensation, he
would say, “If you notice any stress here or any stress there, what are you doing
that’s causing the stress?” And then, “Can you stop doing that?” As you’d go
deeper into concentration, you’d get more sensitive to the levels of stress you
hadn’t noticed before. Finally, you reached the point where the breath stopped.
I noticed, as I was listening to him teach other people, that the descriptions of
how people felt their breath would be very diﬀerent at the beginning, but as the
practice got to the point where it settled down and the breath stopped, from that
point on, everybody’s practice was the same. e conclusion I came to is that as
you’re getting the mind into concentration, when you experience a level of
stillness that might be the rst jhāna, you put a Post-it note on it. en if you
come to a level of stillness that goes deeper and might be the second jhāna, put
another Post-it note there. You keep this up until you nally get to the point
where the breath stops and you can stay comfortably with the sensation that the
breath has stopped. en you know, “ is is the fourth jhāna.” en, if need be,
you go back and rearrange your other Post-it notes.
I had an experience once when I was camping in Utah. We were going to a
place called Powell Point. e guidebook had said that from Powell Point you
could see diﬀerent mountain ranges across southern Utah. You’re up at 10,000
feet, and you have an immense view across the southern part of the state. We
turned oﬀ the wrong road, though, and it took us to a point, and we gured,
“ is must be Powell Point,” so we got out and we looked around. We saw
mountain ranges here and there, so we tried to identify which range
corresponded to the ranges described in the guidebook: “ is must be that
mountain and that must be this mountain.” We had names for all the mountains.
But the problem was that there was one large cliﬀ oﬀ to the east that wasn’t in the


127

book. A er a while, we realized that that was Powell Point. So, the next day, we
went up to Powell Point, and there we realized that the other mountains we had
seen the previous day were not really the mountains we thought they were.
Do I need to explain that image?
e important thing about jhāna is that you learn how to deal with the
pleasures and pains that come up. At rst, you’re going to be dealing with pain as
you try to get the mind into concentration, and you have to be unafraid of the
pain. You nd that with enough directed thought and proper evaluation, you can
actually work around the pain, work through the pain, dissolve the pain, and you
become less and less afraid of pain.
At the same time though, you have to become more and more skillful with
pleasure. As we’ve noted many times in the guided meditation, when the breath
becomes pleasant, there is a danger of leaving the breath and going for the
pleasure, so you have to learn how not to give in to the temptation to simply
wallow in the pleasure.
As a result, when you’re working with jhāna, you learn how to deal more
eﬀectively with both pleasure and pain, and not be overcome by them. And as the
Buddha says, an important point of having the mind well-trained and well-
developed is that you train it not to be overcome either by pain or by pleasure.
At the same time, when you learn how to get more separated from the
pleasure and pain, and not be so aﬀected by them, this is how practice in
concentration puts you on the middle way. As you may remember, the middle
way avoids the pain of self-torture and also the extreme of sensual pleasure. Now,
the fact that it’s in the middle doesn’t mean that it’s a neutral feeling halfway
between pleasure and pain. It’s not the middle of the snake. It’s something outside
of this continuum of running back and forth between pain and sensual pleasure.
e pleasure of jhāna puts you in a position where you can look at pleasure and
pain, and actually use them, instead of running toward the pleasure and running
away from the pain. From that position, you can learn how to analyze the pain
and learn about the mind in the process. at’s the rst noble truth. Jhāna also
teaches you how to be with pleasure and not be attached to it. It also helps you
gain some detachment from sensual pleasures, so that you can look at them
objectively and be willing to admit their drawbacks. is is how you get on the
right track for developing the discernment that leads to awakening.



128

Listening to this, you should realize that renunciation is not simply
deprivation. It’s actually a trade—a trade up. You’re trading your everyday
pleasures for skills in the mind that enable you to deal skillfully with both
pleasure and pain, and not be overcome by them. at’s what allows you to free
yourself from them.
is is one of the reasons why the Buddha said that concentration is the heart
of the path—and why renunciation is one of the most important of the
perfections.

QUESTIONS

Q: Is there a diﬀerence between jhāna and samādhi, and if so, what is it?
A: Samādhi means any way of concentrating the mind on one object. Jhāna is
a type of samādhi where you’re focused on one object but you also have a full-
body awareness at the same time. Jhāna is required for the path because it’s only
from the basis of that state of mind that you can actually see clearly what’s going
on in the entire mind.

Q: Would it be correct to de ne right concentration basically as the activity
of skillfully holding skillful perceptions in the mind?
A: Most of the states of right concentration do require perceptions. When
you hold on to, say, the perception of the breath, that helps you stay concentrated
on the breath. What makes it concentration is that you hold on to one perception
continually.

Q: I don’t really know the characteristics of the diﬀerent jhānas. At what
point should I look into this?
A: When you begin noticing that the mind settles down on diﬀerent levels or
with diﬀerent characteristics, that’s when you get out your Post-it notes to place
on the diﬀerent types of concentration you notice. If and when you nally do get
to the point where the breath stops and it stays comfortably still, that’s when you
put on the note that says “fourth jhāna.” en you look at however many jhānas
you’ve labeled before that and you can move the Post-it notes around a little bit.
In most of the descriptions of jhāna in the Canon, the Buddha describes four
levels of jhāna of form, but there are some where he describes ve, and some


129

where he describes three. You’ll gure out how many you have only a er you’ve
gotten to the point where the breath stops.

Q: While meditating, I use verbal fabrication to keep my concentration,
almost like a guided meditation, although I’m guiding myself. Is it okay to do it
this way?
A: Yes. e rst jhāna includes verbal fabrication of this sort, to help get the
mind and its object to t snugly together. Once they’re snug, then you can drop
the verbal fabrication, to see if you can simply stay with the perception of breath.

Q: Any advice on how to develop even more concentration and maybe not
always have to verbally fabricate?
A: You do the verbal fabrication as long as you feel a need to adjust things in
the mind and in the body. When things seem relatively good, then you can try
staying focused on the sensation of the breath, telling yourself, “I don’t need to
make any adjustments.” Now, if it turns out that you can’t stay continuously with
that state, go back to adjusting the breath and adjusting the mind until things
seem better, and then try settling in there again. Finally, you will get to a point
where you can stay with just that one sensation without the need to talk a lot
about it. But you’ll still need to hold a perception—in other words, the simple
label of “breath” or “aware”—in the mind.

Q: In working on the perfection of renunciation or relinquishment, it appears
to be necessary to meditate on the four noble truths. In our meditation, at what
moment do we start doing that? Also, how is it done?
A: Actually, when you’re working with the breath in the way I’ve described,
you’re already beginning to deal with the framework of the four noble truths. You
notice where there is tension and you ask yourself, “What’s causing the tension?”
Once you identify that, you try to let go of the cause. You notice that the tension
goes when the cause has been abandoned. And identifying both the tension and
the cause requires that you develop your mindfulness and concentration. So,
you’re already dealing in terms of the four noble truths and the duties appropriate
to each, simply that as your concentration deepens, your understanding of those
four noble truths will deepen as well.



130

Some people have been describing visions they’ve been having during their
meditation. Always remember that the basic rule of thumb is always to ask
yourself with regard to any vision: What is the Dhamma lesson of this vision?
ere was one person who recorded a vision of being surrounded by clear water
and had a fear of becoming dirty again. In a case like that, when you come out of
the vision, you ask yourself, “What does it mean to be dirty?” Maybe it means
breaking the precepts. So, the lesson you learn from that is to be careful about
your precepts. en let the vision go.




131

DAY EIGHT
MORNING

Maintaining Concentration
e question sometimes arises: A er you’ve done the body scan, you nally
settle down at one spot and you spread your awareness to ll the entire body, and
then, what’s next? “What’s next” is just maintaining what you’ve got. Try to make
sure that no other thought comes in to disturb the stillness of your awareness.
Now, if your focus begins to get a little bit vague, a little bit blurry, go back to the
body scan. Or you can focus special attention on any one spot where you nd
that there’s an energy problem. As that strengthens your concentration, then you
can go back to the whole body.
Watch out for the thought that says, “ is is boring.” Just tell yourself that
that thought is a disturbance. You don’t have to believe it. Or, if a thought comes
in and says, “ is is stupid; the mind isn’t thinking any intelligent thoughts at
all,” tell yourself that you don’t have to be intelligent all the time. You’re learning
how to step back from your thoughts. is is an important skill, an exercise in a
diﬀerent kind of intelligence, so you protect what you’ve got.
Now, you begin to notice that even before a thought forms, there will be a
little knot of tension appearing someplace in your awareness. e mind will have
a tendency to focus there to decide whether it’s a physical tension or a mental
tension. If it decides it’s a mental tension, then it will take that mental tension
and turn it into a thought. It’ll slap a perception on it, saying, “ is is a thought
about x, and so, let’s go with it.” at’s how thoughts and disturbances take over
the mind.
So, try to catch the thought at the moment when it’s just a little knot of
tension. Zap it with a good breath and it’ll dissolve away. en watch out for the
next little knot of tension. It’s like being a spider on a web. e spider is at one
spot on the web. All of a sudden, a y comes and hits another spot. e spider
will immediately go and take care of the y and then return to its original spot.
So, try to make this your sport: shooting down these thoughts before they turn
into something big.


132

In this way, as you watch over your concentration, it will become deeper and
deeper. en part of the mind says, “I’ve rested enough.” Again, remind yourself
you’re not here just to rest. You’re here to learn about the mind. And one of the
best ways to learn about the mind is to see the diﬀerent stages by which thoughts
form. In this way, you take charge of your thoughts, instead of letting your
thoughts be in charge of you, and the process of protecting your concentration
becomes the process by which you gain insights into the mind’s fabrications.

QUESTIONS

Q: e quality and depth of my concentration has been decreasing since I
started applying directed thought and evaluation to my mind . Instead of
applying directed thought and evaluation, should I just let the meditation ow
more freely?
A: When you apply directed thought and evaluation, it should primarily be
directed toward the breath with very simple questions: “Is the breath
comfortable? Could it be more comfortable? If it is comfortable, how can I
maintain that? And then, when I’m maintaining the comfort, can I let it spread?”
Try not to evaluate anything much more than that. However, if even that much is
disturbing, just pose the question in the mind each time you breathe in: “What
kind of breathing would feel good now?” See how the body responds.

Q: If we’re able to concentrate on the more subtle breath energy in the body,
should we focus on that and let the in-and-out breath go into the background?
A: Yes.

Q: Second question: If the breath stops while in concentration, we wouldn’t
die, right?
A: Most of the time, you won’t die. But if it does happen that you die, it’s
good to be in concentration. Now, it is possible for the body to survive without
breathing as long as the mind is really, really quiet. How that happens, I can’t
explain in terms of modern physiology, but it does happen.

Q: Regarding the steps of breath meditation listed in the Canon, my rst
question is: What does it mean to discern, “I am breathing in long” or “I’m


133

breathing in short”? What does that mean and how does that apply to the
practice?
A: It simply means being sensitive to the quality of the breath. And you don’t
stop with just noticing whether it’s long or short. You can also notice the eﬀect
that long and short breathing have on the body, because in further steps you’ll be
trying to breathe in and out calming bodily fabrication, and then breathing in
and out sensitive to pleasure and rapture. So, it’s good to notice what kind of
breathing is calming, what kind is conducive to pleasure and rapture.

Q: Second question: Do the sixteen steps have to be mastered in order?
A: e sixteen steps come in sets of four, called tetrads in English. e rst
tetrad has to do with the body; the second one with feelings; the third with the
mind. When you’re getting the mind to settle down with the breath, you’re
dealing with all these three things at once: body, feelings, and mind. Whichever
aspect is the problem, that’s the tetrad you’ll focus on. For instance, if the breath
is uncomfortable, you focus your primary attention on the body and the breath. If
the mind is disobedient, you focus primary attention on the step of steadying it.
Now, within each tetrad, there’s a pattern. You become sensitive to how you’re
fabricating that particular aspect of your experience, you fabricate it in a way that
gives rise to a sense of energy, well-being, or rapture, and then you fabricate it in
such a way as to calm things down. So, within each tetrad, the steps are mastered
in order, but there’s no particular order from tetrad to tetrad.

Q: And then the last question is: How are your instructions on meditation
speci cally related to these sixteen steps?
A: e instructions I’m giving are primarily related to the rst four steps in
the rst tetrad, which is to be sensitive to the breathing, to be aware of the whole
body as you breathe in and out, and then to calm the breath as you’re breathing
in, breathing out. However, we’re also dealing with the second and third tetrads
indirectly. In the second tetrad, we’re following the steps of being sensitive to
pleasure, rapture, and the eﬀect that pleasure, rapture, and your perceptions have
on the mind, and then calming that eﬀect down. Within the third tetrad, we’re
focusing on the steps of being sensitive to the mind, trying to breathe in a way
that gives energy to the mind if the mind is lacking energy, to steady the mind if it



134

has too much energy. So, the meditation we’re doing deals with many of the steps
listed in the Canon.

Q: Do you consider that the experience of steps 5 and 6 in the sutta on breath
meditation correspond to the rst and second jhānas? Do you see other
connections between these steps of breath meditation and jhānas?
A: As I just said, there are four tetrads in the 16 steps of breath meditation.
e rst tetrad corresponds to the body, the second to feelings, the third to the
mind, and the fourth to dhammas or mental qualities. It’s not the case that you
work on the body and then you work on feelings and then you work on the mind.
Right from the beginning, you’re going to be working on the rst three together:
body, feelings, and mind.
In the rst tetrad, the one dealing with the body, step number 4 is calming
bodily fabrication. Bodily fabrication is the in-and-out breath. at step
corresponds to all four jhānas as the breath gets more and more calm to the point
where it nally stops.
As for the steps dealing with the third tetrad, dealing with the mind, these,
too, would also be equivalent to the jhānas, but the numbers of the steps don’t
correspond to the diﬀerent stages of jhāna.
In the second tetrad, on feelings, you go into the rst and second jhānas in the
rst two steps (5 and 6), dealing with rapture and pleasure. en you get to 7 and
8, where you become sensitive to mental fabrications—feelings and perceptions
—and then calm them down. e calmest feeling is equanimity, which is present
in the third and fourth jhāna. e calmest perceptions are those that aid in that
process, taking you to the fourth jhāna and potentially beyond it, into the
formless states, as you focus on perceptions of in nite space, in nite
consciousness, and nothingness.

Q: When I begin to nd myself getting established in the second jhāna, my
breath completely goes out of whack. e need for oxygen seems to be much less,
things are suddenly quiet, and yet both the mind and the body still need to
breathe at a normal rate. I nd myself almost suﬀocating without knowing what
to do. Can you give me some advice?
A: e rst piece of advice is not to try to enter the second jhāna. Don’t force
yourself to stop breathing. And you don’t have to move from the concentration


135

where you already are in order for your concentration to develop. Allow it to
develop at its own rhythm and pace. When it does deepen, it’ll deepen with a
sense of doing it naturally without any pressure. It’s like a piece of fruit on a tree.
To ripen, it doesn’t have to go anywhere, and you don’t have to squeeze it to make
it so . It just stays right there and, as it’s nourished, it ripens on its own.

Q: Bhante, I have developed an attachment to very re ned mental states. I am
mostly now stuck in the third jhāna. How do I reenter these states with the
proper skillful attitude?
A: e third jhāna is a pretty good place to be stuck, because there are many
worse places you can be stuck. e only times when these states become a
problem is when you refuse to leave concentration in order to take care of your
daily duties. Otherwise, if the mind wants to stay there and rest, let it rest for a
while. en, the next question to ask yourself is, “Is there still some disturbance in
this state?” ere may be a very subtle level of stress that goes up and down.
When you notice the ups and downs, ask yourself, “What am I doing when the
stress goes up? What am I doing when the stress goes down?” In that way, you
actually use the state of concentration to gain insight into the mind.

Q: Could you give us a guided meditation on the dissolution of the body and
pure awareness, which would be the fourth and the h jhānas? Or could you
give some indications?
A: I would love to get all of you into those jhānas, but it’s impossible to give a
guided meditation to get you there. Still, I can give you some indications. As you
get settled in with the breath and gain a sense that your awareness and the breath
are one, and that all of the breath channels in the body are connected, just stay
with that sensation of everything being connected. A er a while, you nd that
your need to breathe gets weaker and weaker, and then you get to the point where
you don’t feel like you’re breathing at all. Your rst reaction will usually be fear
that you’re going to die. But you can remind yourself: “As long as I’m aware in the
body, I’m not going to die.” If the body needs to breathe, it will. If you can simply
stay balanced at that sensation of total stillness in the body, a er a while you’ll feel
that you’re solidly there. You’re comfortable there.
en you begin to notice that the sense of the outline or the surface of the
body begins to disappear, and the body feels like a cloud of sensation dots. You


136

can stay with that sensation of a cloud for a while. en you begin to notice that
if you focus on the space between the sensations, that sense of space permeates
your entire body and spreads out from the body in all directions, without your
sensing any boundary or limit. at’s the in nitude of space, and you should stay
with that perception of space until the perception is steady and solid. en you
can ask yourself, “What is aware of the space?” and there will be a perception of
pure awareness, and you can just stay with that perception. at, too, has no
boundaries. Once you can do that, then let me know, and I’ll tell you what to do
next.

Q: Is meditation only for the purpose of attaining the jhānas? Is that
bene cial as a practice? Or should the daily practice also include right view, right
resolve, right action, right speech, right livelihood in order to give bene ts?
A: e practice of concentration on its own can give bene ts, but if you’re
doing it with wrong view, it can also lead to harm. e other factors of the path
are needed to protect your concentration and turn it into right concentration.
For example, if you practice concentration with wrong view, there are some states
that you get into when you feel that you’ve touched the ground of being,
especially if you develop a sense of consciousness in and of itself, and you notice
that no matter what you do, that consciousness remains unaﬀected. at might
give rise to the idea that you can do anything and that that consciousness won’t be
harmed. is is how some meditators think that they’re beyond good and evil,
and they start doing some very unskillful things. So, it’s safest if you practice all
factors of the path.

Q: When I was rst learning meditation, I was told it was not a matter of
emptying the mind and then not having any thoughts, but of observing the
thoughts as they come and then regarding them as on a movie screen, simply not
following them as they go. is is in contradiction with what you’ve been
teaching us, teaching us how not to think. Are these two diﬀerent types of
meditation? Can you say more about this? And is the rst technique bad?
A: It’s more a question of knowing the right time and place for how to relate
to the thoughts of your mind. ere are times when you do have to watch your
thoughts, but there are also times when it’s really good to be able to rest and have
as little thinking as possible. In the very beginning, you have to think about the


137

breath in order to get the breath and the mind to t snugly together. is is why
directed thought and evaluation are part of the rst jhāna. en, when they’ve
done their work, you can put them aside.
As the mind gets quieter, then when you come out of concentration you can
see the processes of thinking a lot more clearly. At the same time, as I was saying
earlier, if you can get the mind really quiet, then as soon as you sense a little
stirring in the body or mind that would be the beginning of a thought, you learn
how to zap it. is is what gives you more understanding into the processes of
how the mind will create a thought and how it will latch on to a thought—and
how you can stop those processes. You can’t gain these insights if you simply
watch the thoughts come and go.
However, there are times when you cannot gure out how to put a stop to
your thinking. ose are good times to simply watch the thoughts come and go
—as long as you stay separate from them—in hopes that you might catch sight of
something that you would have missed otherwise.

Q: e very beginner thinks that meditation is simple: It’s only to sit and to
breathe. A er a while, we think it’s complex and we search for a lot of support
points, like temporary supports of a building. I expect that for the experienced
meditator, the meditation—like a nished building where the temporary
supports have been removed—becomes simple again. A er all: It’s just to sit and
to breathe. Am I correct?
A: e practice of concentration does get simpler as you get better at it. And
the development of discernment tries to boil things down to one major question:
What is the ignorance that causes us to create unnecessary suﬀering for ourselves?
e work of discernment, however, grows more and more subtle as it gets closer
and closer to the real cause. So, it’s not necessarily simpler as you go along. e
concentration gets simpler, but the work of discernment gets more demanding as
it become more subtle.

Q: Is success in meditation analogous to recovering a lost friendship?
A: In many ways, yes, especially in the practice of concentration. However, as
you develop insight, you may nd the mind going to places it’s never been before.

EVENING


138

Endurance
Tonight, we begin the discussion of the perfections coming under the heading
of calm. Tonight, we’ll discuss endurance, and tomorrow night, equanimity.
As I noted the other day, many of the forest ajaans noticed that when
Westerners came to study with them, these were the two qualities they lacked
most. So, I’ll have to go into them in detail. We’ll notice, as we’re discussing them,
that these two perfections are very closely related to the practice of concentration
and the practice of discernment. You’re going to need both endurance and
equanimity in order to develop concentration, and these two qualities will also
have to depend on your powers of concentration in order to maintain them. We’ll
also discover that, in developing them, we have to use our background in
discernment, particularly our knowledge of the three fabrications.
e Pāli word for endurance, the perfection we’ll discuss tonight, is khanti.
is word can also be translated as “patience” or “tolerance.” As with all the other
perfections, it’s rooted in desire: basically, our desire to stick with our skillful
desires in spite of the pain and other hardships that following through with our
skillful desires may entail. is, in turn, is based on a desire for independence:
You don’t want your goodness to have to depend on the goodness of others or on
the goodness of the situation in which you nd yourself.
ink of the story of Lady Vedehikā in the readings. She was the one who had
a reputation for being kind and gentle, so her female slave, Kālī, decided, “Well,
does she have this reputation because she really is kind and gentle, or is it simply
because I’m always good in my work?” So, Kālī tested her. One day, she woke up a
little bit later than normal, and her mistress got a little upset. e slave said to
herself, “Ah, there is anger present in her. Let’s test her some more.” e next day,
Kālī woke up even later, and the mistress got even angrier. Kālī said to herself,
“Ah, she really is angry. Let’s test her again.” On the third day, she got up even
later. e mistress got so upset that she hit Kālī over the head with a rolling pin.
So, Kālī, her head bleeding, went to denounce her mistress to the neighbors.
From that point on, Lady Vedehikā had a reputation for being harsh and violent.
e point of this story is to remind you that you don’t want your goodness to
have to depend on the goodness of others. If it’s dependent on them, you can’t
rely on it yourself.

Endurance is a quality that, when you develop it, is a way of helping others
and helping yourself at the same time. If you respond to hardships with anger, it
creates trouble for yourself and creates trouble for the people around you.
However, if you can restrain your anger, then you bene t, and the people around
you bene t as well. is is why, in the Canon, endurance is directly linked to the
perfection of goodwill.
Now, as I said, we have to apply discernment to our practice of tolerance or
endurance. One way to do this is to remember the framework of the three kinds
of fabrication, and to use that framework to fabricate mind states that strengthen
endurance and make it easier.
When I returned to America a er many years in ailand, some people asked
me, “What was the hardest thing you had to put up with while practicing in
ailand?” I couldn’t think of anything in particular. is made me realize that
that was probably why I was able to endure a lot of hardships over there: I wasn’t
focusing on the hardships; I was focusing on the things that were interesting and
good. at can strengthen endurance: You don’t focus on what’s hard. Instead,
you focus on what’s supporting and energizing you.
For example, with the three kinds of fabrication, no matter how diﬃcult
things are outside, you can always breathe comfortably. ere are no breath
police, and they haven’t privatized your breath yet, so it’s still yours to do with as
you like.
Secondly, with verbal fabrication, a lot of endurance has to do with how you
talk to yourself about the situation. For instance, there’s o en a belief that if
someone mistreats you and you don’t respond with anger, they will see you as
weak. So, to counteract that belief, you have to hold in mind the perception that
endurance is a strength. Also, by not showing your feelings, you’re putting
yourself in a safer position. You keep in mind the fact that if other people know
what makes you angry, they can control you.
I was once giving a talk to a group of people in the California desert, and the
morning a er the talk one of the students said, “You know, I realized a er your
talk last night that I was very angry at you, so I asked myself why. I thought it
over a erwards, and I realized that it was because I didn’t know where your
buttons are.” ( is is a common expression in America: It’s as if the other person
is a machine, you push the button, and the machine does what you want it to.) I



140

smiled and said, “ is is one of the reasons why we monks wear robes, so that no
one can see where our buttons are.”
So, from the Buddha’s point of view, not reacting is a position of strength. is
doesn’t mean that you don’t try to correct injustices and misbehavior. It means
that you simply stay calm enough to gure out what would be the best time and
place to respond to a diﬃcult situation. is is a good thing to tell yourself when
you’re faced with a diﬃcult situation: that you’re in a stronger position if you
don’t react. It allows you to nd the proper way to respond. at’s a good verbal
fabrication to hold in mind.
As for mental fabrications, suppose somebody is attacking you verbally. Mark
Twain had a good perception to hold in mind, which is that it’s not wise to ght
with a pig. One, you’ll get dirty; and two, it pleases the pig.
Note the importance of using your sense of humor to—as we say in English
—“make light” of diﬃculties. We’ve already seen the element of humor in the
story of Lady Vedehikā. But the use of humor in developing endurance is
something universal and contains an element of folk wisdom.
ere was a British explorer in Canada back in the 1830s who wanted to nd
a copper deposit that was said to be in the Northwest Territories. He couldn’t
nd anyone to guide him there except for a group of Dene natives. So, he decided
to go with them. It was one of the rst cases of a British explorer entrusting his
life to the natives. As they were going across the territory, they lived oﬀ their
hunting and shing skills. He noticed that on the days when the hunting and
shing were bad, those were the days when the Dene were telling the most jokes,
to keep their spirits up in spite of the hunger.
ese are some of the ways that you use your knowledge of fabrication to help
you endure a situation.
e other use of discernment in strengthening endurance is to see clearly what
should and shouldn’t be tolerated. e basic distinction comes down to the
diﬀerence between the results of past kamma and your present kamma: You
should learn to tolerate the results of past kamma, but you don’t tolerate any
unskillful kamma you might do right now.
In terms of the results of past kamma, the Buddha focuses on two things that
you should tolerate: harsh words and pain.




141

e Buddha’s basic approach for learning how to endure harsh words is to
depersonalize them. In one case, he has you remind yourself that human speech
has many aspects. It’s normal that there will be kind words and harsh words, true
words and false words, things said to you with good intentions and things said to
you with bad intentions. So, if someone lies or says something harsh to you, it’s
nothing out of the ordinary. is is the nature of human speech.
Sometimes, when I was living in ailand, people would insult me. I would
remind myself, “I was the one who made the eﬀort to learn the ai language, so
it’s my fault that I understand them.” at’s one way of depersonalizing things, to
realize that this is the nature of human speech. As they say in ailand, “Even the
Buddha was criticized, so what should I expect?”
e second way of depersonalizing harsh words is when someone says
something nasty to you, you just tell yourself, “An unpleasant sound has made
contact at the ear.” And just leave it there, at the ear. e problem is that we tend
not to leave it there. We pull it into the mind. Our minds are like vacuum cleaners
that pull in only the dirt. So, who are you going to blame? You’re the one who
pulled it in.
Ajaan Lee has a nice image. He says if someone says something nasty to you,
it’s as if they’ve spat something out on the ground. If you take it to brood about,
it’s as if you’ve picked up to eat what they’ve spat out. And if you get a
stomachache, who are you going to blame? We can also build on his image to say
that if you put their food in your mouth to spit it back at them—in other words,
you ing an insult back at a person who insulted you—you look foolish, and
you’ve picked up whatever germs were there in the food. In other words, the other
person’s bad kamma now becomes yours.
ese are ways of using verbal fabrication and mental fabrication to help you
to endure harsh words by depersonalizing them.
As for pain, we talked about this the other day, in terms of the second tetrad in
breath meditation: You learn how to breathe with a sense of rapture, breathe with
a sense of ease. en you try to notice which perceptions are making the pain
worse, and you change the perceptions to calm the mind down.
e Buddha oﬀers another approach when you’re in pain. Once Devadatta
tried to kill the Buddha by rolling a rock down a mountain. e rock hit another
rock and split into slivers, and one of the slivers pierced the Buddha’s foot. A er
the sliver was removed, the Buddha lay down with a lot of pain. Māra came to


142

taunt him: “You sleepy head, are you miserable because someone tried to kill
you?” And the Buddha said, “No, I’m lying here spreading goodwill and
sympathy to all beings.”
I’ve personally found that when I’m sick, spreading thoughts of goodwill as far
as I can is a good way to deal with the illness. It keeps the mind from complaining
about the illness and expands it to a much larger state, like the river into which
the lump of salt has been thrown.
So, those are the two things you have to learn how to tolerate: harsh words
and physical pain. Using discernment and developing your powers of
concentration can help in both cases. You’ll notice that, in both cases, you’re
following the steps in the second tetrad of breath meditation. We’ve already made
this point explicitly when explaining how to deal with pain, but it applies to
dealing with harsh words as well. You focus on breathing comfortably while
you’re being verbally attacked—that’s bodily fabrication—which keeps you from
adding unnecessary stress to the situation, and then you nd ways of perceiving
the situation—that’s mental fabrication—to calm the mind down.
Now, the things that you don’t tolerate are your unskillful mind states. e
Buddha says that if greed, aversion, or delusion arise in the mind, you don’t let
them stay. You try to get them out of the mind in the same way that you’d try to
put out a re burning the hair on your head.
is distinction between the things you should and shouldn’t tolerate has a
parallel with the Buddha’s teachings on contentment. You learn to be content
with your physical surroundings, in terms of food, clothing, and shelter. If these
requisites are good enough to allow you to practice, then they’re good enough.
But you’re not content with your level of skillfulness. As long as you nd that the
mind is still causing itself suﬀering, you have to say, “I’ve got to do better.”
Now, one of the types of tolerance that’s not mentioned in the texts is when
you nd yourself in a situation where it’s diﬃcult to practice and you have too
many responsibilities to get out of the situation. In a case like that, my teachers
have said not to focus on the diﬃculties. Instead, focus on the things you can do.
e ajaans in ailand are o en told by people, “I don’t have any time to
meditate,” and the ajaans always respond, “Do you have time to breathe?” “Yes.”
“In that case, you have time to practice.”
Ajaan Maha Boowa had a student, a woman in her 60s, who was dying of bone
cancer, and she asked his permission to mediate at his monastery to prepare for


143

her coming death. He told her to bring a doctor along, as he had no medical
knowledge. She had a friend who was a retired doctor, an elderly woman in her
80s, who agreed to go with her.
ey stayed for three months, and he gave them a Dhamma talk almost every
night. A er they returned to Bangkok, the old doctor decided to transcribe the
talks, which they had recorded on tape. Her health wasn’t good, and her eyesight
was poor, but she managed to transcribe all the talks—almost 90 in all.
She said that she took encouragement from one of Ajaan Maha Boowa’s
teachings: that as you get older and your body is failing, try to squeeze as much
goodness out of it as you can before you have to throw it away.
at’s a thought we should all keep in mind.
So, we can regard our diﬃculties as opportunities to develop the perfections.
When I was looking a er my teacher, there were times when it would take all
hours of the day and night to look a er him, but I kept telling myself, “I’m
learning good lessons.” Prior to looking a er him, I was not very good at looking
a er people who were sick. I always thought that I was doing them a big favor.
But with Ajaan Fuang, I never got the sense that I was doing him any favor at all.
For instance, I would have to be up with him two or three nights in a row, and
then when he nally got better, he would say, “You can go oﬀ anywhere you
want.” No, “ ank you.” Just, “Go.” I realized I had to do this not for the thank
you, but for the good qualities I was developing: patience and endurance. at’s
the attitude you have to adopt when things are diﬃcult around you. ere are a
lot of things you can’t change or that will take a while to change, but if you regard
them as a challenge to develop the perfections, then they actually become part of
the practice.

QUESTIONS

Q: Are emotions all mental fabrications?
A: Emotions are composed of bodily, verbal, and mental fabrications. For
example, when anger comes, you’ll be breathing in a certain way, talking to
yourself in a certain way, and then holding certain perceptions and physical
feelings in mind.

Q: And the next question: Can you trust your emotions?


144

A: No. You made them up. As with anything you’ve fabricated, you have to
ask yourself: “Is this emotion skillful? If it’s not skillful, which fabrications do I
have to change?”




145

DAY NINE
MORNING

Grief & Remorse
Tonight’s talk will be on equanimity. It’s a large topic—so large that we’ll have
to split it into two parts, and give one of them this morning.
One of the main points in understanding equanimity is that the Buddha never
recommends equanimity on its own. On its own, he says, equanimity can very
easily become unskillful. is is why, when discussing the development of
equanimity, he always lists it in conjunction with the development of other
skillful qualities.
To introduce this principle this morning, I’d like to discuss two big areas in
daily life where developing skillful equanimity is especially helpful: when dealing
with grief over loss, and when dealing with remorse for mistakes you have made.
When you see how the Buddha’s recommendations for equanimity in these cases
involve developing other qualities as well, you can get a sense of how equanimity
is meant to function, not only in everyday life, but also on more re ned levels of
the practice.
First, grief: Grief over loss covers not only the death of a loved one, but also
the loss of a loved one in other ways—or the loss of love itself.
ere are a couple of passages in the Canon where the Buddha talks about
how to deal with grief. One involves King Pasenadi. One day, while he was
talking to the Buddha, one of his courtiers came to inform him that ueen
Mallikā, his favorite queen, had died. King Pasenadi immediately broke down
and cried. e Buddha’s way of comforting him was to point out to him that this
kind of thing was happening not only to him. He said, “When has it ever
happened that someone who was born does not die?” In other words, this kind of
loss is universal. It happens to everyone.
It may seem strange that thinking about all the many deaths in the world
would actually make your own loss less sharp, but it actually does. You remind
yourself, “It’s not happening only to me.” You’re not being singled out for any
suﬀering that’s out of the ordinary. In fact, thinking about the universality of loss


146

might lead you to feel compassion for others that have undergone the same sort
of loss that you have. is can so en your grief, by giving you some distance from
it without trying to deny the loss. At the same time, it can direct your energies
toward acting with more consideration for others.
e Buddha then goes on to say that as long as you see that some purpose is
served by grieving, by giving eulogies, or by conducting funeral ceremonies for
someone who has died, go ahead and do it. is way, you give honor to what you
have lost, recognizing the goodness in what is now past. is can encourage you
—and the people around you—to devote the remainder of your life to more
goodness. At the same time, it’s traditional in Buddhist funeral ceremonies to
make merit and dedicate it to the deceased, both as an expression of your
goodwill for the deceased and as a reminder that you are not totally helpless in
the face of death: ere are still things that you can do for the person who has
passed on.
But then when you realize that your expressions of grief have reached the
point of self-indulgence, you have to remind yourself that you have a life you have
to live and duties you have to perform, so don’t let the loss overcome you. In this
case, you develop equanimity toward the loss and re-dedicate your determination
to return to ful lling your duties, both for the sake of your genuine happiness and
for the happiness of those still around you. In this way, you develop equanimity as
a basis for two other perfections: determination and goodwill.
e Canon has a very interesting analysis of grief. ere was one time when
Ven. Sāriputta was talking to some of the other monks, saying, “ is a ernoon I
was sitting and meditating, and I asked myself, ‘Is there anyone in the world
whose loss would cause me any sorrow or grief ?’” e answer to the question was
No. Ven. Ānanda was sitting there and he asked, “Now, wait a minute. What if
something happened to the Buddha?” And Sāriputta replied, “I would say that it’s
a sad thing that such a great and bene cial person has passed away. It would be a
great loss for the world. But what could be done? is is the nature of all living
beings.” en Ānanda made an interesting comment, which was that, “ is is a
sign that you have no conceit.”
Now, remember that conceit in this sense means a strong sense of “I am.”
What Ānanda was saying here is that a lot of our grief has to do less with concern
for the suﬀering of the other person who’s passed away and more with our own
sense of loss. Sometimes there’s a feeling that you owe the person who’s passed


147

away a certain amount of grief. But the other person is not bene ting from your
grief at all. So, you really have no responsibility or debt that requires you to grieve
for a person for a certain amount of time or with a certain amount of intensity.
e irony of this story is that Ven. Sāriputta actually passed away before the
Buddha. Ānanda went to see the Buddha to deliver the news, telling him that
hearing the news of Sāriputta’s death made him lose his sense of bearings. e
world seemed dark to him. e Buddha asked Ānanda, “When Sāriputta died,
did he take away virtue?” “No.” “Did he take away concentration?” “No.” “Did he
take away discernment?” “No.” “Did he take away release?” “No.” So, the good
things in life are still there. ese are some of the ways in which the Buddha
would talk to the monks about loss.
In more general terms, you have to remember that the amount of tears you
have already shed from the death of a mother is more than the amount of water in
the oceans. e same goes for the amount of tears you’ve shed over the death of a
father, the loss of a brother, the loss of a sister, the loss of a son, the loss of a
daughter. When you think about that, it becomes overwhelming. e Buddha
adds that thinking about this should make you realize that the best thing in life
would be to gain release from all of this.
is kind of thinking, which comes under the perfection of discernment, can
help you develop a certain amount of equanimity around loss and lead to a sense
of saṁvega, or dismay, motivating your determination to practice further on the
path.
Now, the Buddha’s not forcing you to give up your grief. at would be
heartless. What he’s actually doing is giving you the opportunity to realize that
your life does not have to be ruined by a loss.
ere are two examples of women whom he comforted a er they had lost
their children. In one case, it was her son, and one of the contemplations he
recommended to her was this: “He came to you without permission and he’s le
you without permission. Do you know where he came from? Was he yours before
he came? And now he’s gone, to another unknown place.” He added, “ is is the
nature of all beings.” e woman later said that this calmed her mind and
completely removed the arrow of her grief.
e other case was a woman named Ubbiri. She had lost her daughter, Jīvā,
and she had gone to the cemetery, where she was crying, “Jīvā, Jīvā, where are
you?” e Buddha said to her, “Do you realize that 84,000 women named Jīvā


148

have been buried in that cemetery? So for which of them are you grieving?” e
sense of the vast extent of all the loss that human beings have suﬀered does help
to pull you out of your individual grief and to view the whole situation with a lot
more equanimity.
So, we can see that, in the face of loss, the Buddha doesn’t advise overcoming
your grief simply by numbing yourself into equanimity. Equanimity, to be skillful
in situations like this, has to be developed together with other perfections, such as
discernment, goodwill, and determination.
e second situation where the Buddha talks about using equanimity to get
over your emotional upset regarding things in the past deals with remorse for
your own mistakes. He says that no matter how much remorse you have for what
you’ve done, remorse cannot go back and undo what you did. Sometimes there’s a
childish thought that if we punish ourselves enough over a past mistake, then no
one else will punish us. You’ve probably seen dogs act this way, right? ey wet on
your carpet and they know they did something wrong, so when you come back to
the house they turn over on their back and look miserable, in hopes that if they
look miserable enough, you won’t hit them. ere is this aspect of the human
mind as well.
But, as the Buddha says, this accomplishes nothing. Simply recognize the
mistake—“Yes, that was a mistake”—and determine not to repeat the mistake.
at determination, which is then carried out in the persistence of your right
eﬀorts, is really all that can be asked of a human being. en at that point, he said,
you develop thoughts of goodwill, compassion, and equanimity for all beings:
yourself, the people you’ve wronged, and the other people you will be dealing
with in the future. is way, by not punishing yourself over the mistake and still
wishing goodwill for yourself, you don’t weaken yourself. By extending goodwill
to others, you erase any resentment you might have for the person you wronged,
and you remind yourself to be careful in how you treat others from now on.
In cases like this, the Buddha doesn’t simply have you develop equanimity
toward your past mistakes. He also has you develop discernment into how to use
the teaching on kamma wisely, along with the perfections of goodwill,
determination, and persistence that will ensure that you do your best not to
repeat those mistakes in the future.
ose, then, are two of the areas in daily life—grief and remorse—where the
Buddha talks about how to develop equanimity with regard to things that have


149

happened in the past. In both cases, you’re combining equanimity with other
good qualities, such as discernment, goodwill, persistence, and determination.
ese additional qualities are what ensure that your equanimity doesn’t become
indiﬀerence, and instead becomes skillful equanimity, a perfection that furthers
the path.

EVENING

Equanimity
Our topic tonight is equanimity, the second of the two perfections that come
under the heading of calm in the four determinations.
Both endurance and equanimity play an important role in helping to keep our
persistence going. ey’re the two qualities that give us stamina. ey’re similar
in inducing calm, but they diﬀer in that equanimity is more a matter of
maintaining emotional stability and equilibrium: keeping the mind on an even
keel both in good and in bad situations. It’s your ability to step outside of
emotions that would get in the way of the path. It involves not engaging in the
present-moment fabrication that would keep those emotions going. Endurance,
on the other hand, deals more with your external behavior: not behaving
unskillfully in response to diﬃcult situations, such as unkind words and actions
or physical pain. Ideally, equanimity and endurance work together: You develop
equanimity to provide inner support for external endurance.
Endurance, as you may remember, is based on the desire to make your
goodness independent of the goodness or badness of the people and situations
around you. Equanimity is based more on the desire not to weigh yourself down
with needless emotional baggage.
As we noted earlier, in discussing determination, the quality of calm plays two
roles. It can be either the goal to which we’re headed or else the means by which
we get there. A similar distinction applies to equanimity. ere are three levels of
equanimity altogether: two that function as part of the path, and one that comes
about as a result of reaching the true happiness of the goal. And here it’s
important to emphasize that equanimity is not, in and of itself, the goal. e goal,
as we’ve said many times, is true happiness.



150

e fact that there are these diﬀerent levels of equanimity means that we need
to be careful not to confuse them. If we do, it’ll get in the way of our perseverance
and persistence. For instance, if we experience a strong sense of the rst level of
equanimity and think we’ve already arrived at the goal, we’ll conclude that there’s
nothing more to do. at will undercut any desire to put any further eﬀort into
the path and create an obstacle to nding genuine peace.
e three levels of equanimity are these:
1) Worldly equanimity: your ability to keep the mind on an even keel in the
presence of enticing sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile sensations. is level
of equanimity overlaps to some extent with what the Buddha calls “house-based
equanimity,” which refers to keeping the mind on an even keel in the face of good
or bad sensory input, ranging from the things you experience in everyday life up
through the third jhāna.
2) Unworldly equanimity: the equanimity attained when the mind is in the
fourth jhāna or any of the higher formless attainments.
ese two levels of equanimity function as part of the path.
3) Even more unworldly unworldly equanimity: the sense of inner peace that
arises when, a er you’ve attained full awakening, you re ect on how your mind is
released from passion, aversion, and delusion.
Equanimity is never recommended as a good thing on its own. is is perhaps
the most important point of tonight’s talk, so I’ll repeat it: Equanimity is never
recommended as a good thing on its own. It’s always recommended in conjunction
with right eﬀort and other skillful qualities. In terms of equanimity on the path,
this ts in with the Buddha’s observation—which we discussed under the topic of
persistence—that the causes of suﬀering fall into two types: those that go away
simply when you look at them with equanimity, and those that go away only
when you exert any of the three types of fabrication against them. For instance,
there are cases where lust goes away when you simply watch it steadily. It’s as if it’s
embarrassed to show its face. ere are other times, though, when you stare at
your lust and it stares right back, not the least bit embarrassed. at’s when you
need to make a concerted eﬀort to get rid of it. You have to use your discernment
skillfully to determine which kind of case you’re facing, and you need to have
more than just equanimity in your box of tools.
Equanimity on the rst two levels can be either skillful or unskillful,
depending on the qualities you combine it with, guided by discernment.


151

As with all the perfections, it’s good to understand these two levels of
equanimity in light of right view, particularly in line with the teachings on
kamma, fabrication, and the four noble truths.
• In terms of the rst level of equanimity—ordinary, everyday equanimity—
there are two rules of thumb.
e rst rule is similar to the basic principle underlying when and when not to
practice endurance: You have to be equanimous about the kamma you’ve already
done, along with its results, but not about the kamma you’re planning to do in the
present. However, equanimity can also be applied to uncertainty about the
future. You have to calm your mind and have con dence that, whatever the future
holds, you’ll be best prepared by developing skillful qualities in the mind right
now.
e second rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t develop equanimity that leads
to laziness and defeatism. Instead, develop the sort of equanimity that allows you
to accept setbacks and not get knocked out by them: the kind of equanimity that
allows you to deal with diﬃculties and come out winning.
e forest ajaans give some good examples to illustrate this distinction. A big
storm once went through Ajaan Chah’s monastery, and the next day he was going
through the monastery to check on the damage. He came to one hut and saw that
half the roof had been blown oﬀ. A monk was sitting and meditating in the hut,
so Ajaan Chah asked him, “Why aren’t you xing the roof ?” e monk replied,
“I’m practicing equanimity.” And Ajaan Chah said, “ at’s the equanimity of a
water buﬀalo. You’re a human being. Fix the roof !”
As for the kind of equanimity that involves defeatism and depression, Ajaan
Fuang made a distinction between what he called large-hearted equanimity and
small-hearted equanimity. Small-hearted equanimity is when you resign yourself
to thinking, “I just can’t do anything in life, there’s nothing worth attaining,
everything is inconstant, stressful, and not-self,” so you give up. at’s small-
hearted equanimity. I’ve read a study of some laypeople in Sri Lanka who were
reputed by their friends to be very advanced in the Dhamma because they always
talked about inconstancy, stress, and not-self. Some social scientists gave them a
psychological test and came to the conclusion that they were all suﬀering from
clinical depression. ere’s something really wrong there. at’s not Dhamma. It’s
small-hearted equanimity.



152

Large-hearted equanimity is when you’ve found true happiness inside so that
the events of the world don’t have any eﬀect on you emotionally, because the well-
being you’ve gained is not aﬀected by such things. is is the kind of equanimity
we’re trying to develop.
e Canon, in recommending the type of equanimity to be developed, tends
to list it together with other good qualities. For example, there’s the equanimity
that’s part of the four brahmavihāras. is is the kind of equanimity that
functions well together with goodwill and compassion. You might call it the
equanimity of a good doctor. Every good doctor has goodwill and compassion for
the patient and wants the patient to be cured, but may nd that there are some
symptoms he cannot cure. But he doesn’t give up totally on the patient. He
develops equanimity toward the symptoms he can’t cure so that he can focus on
those he can—or at least on ways in which he can alleviate the patient’s pain and
suﬀering. Instead of trying to force things in areas where he cannot make a
diﬀerence, he channels his goodwill and compassion for the patient in other ways
that are more fruitful and productive. In this way, he doesn’t waste his time and
energy on areas where he cannot give help so that he will have the time and
energy to focus on areas where he can be of help.
When, in the context of the perfections, we combine equanimity with the
perfections of endurance and determination, we’re developing what could be
called the equanimity of a good soldier. A soldier in battle will have to endure
hardships and suﬀer setbacks, but he doesn’t let himself get emotionally upset by
them. at allows him to look for—and nd—ways to come out victorious. is
is the opposite of defeatist equanimity. It’s the equanimity that enables you to
come out winning.
When we apply these lessons to equanimity in daily life, we can see that one of
the purposes of equanimity is to keep us from getting emotionally distracted by
ups and downs that would pull us oﬀ the path. We’ve already talked about the ups
under the perfection of renunciation, so here we’ll focus on the downs:
Equanimity functions well when it helps you to let go of what cannot be
changed—or of something whose change cannot be stopped—so that you can
focus your energy on what can be changed and is worth changing, or on things
changing in the wrong direction where you’re in the position to put a stop to the
change. As we said earlier, this is an area where equanimity, to be skillful, has to
function together with other emotions and mental qualities on the path. In other


153

words, there are some situations in your life where you’re like a doctor: You’re
motivated by goodwill and compassion, but you have to balance them with
equanimity. ere are other times when you have to practice the equanimity of a
soldier: ere are battles you have to ght in life, and you need equanimity to
stay calm in the midst of setbacks.
is is where you develop your mastery of the processes of verbal fabrication
and mental fabrication—in other words, the stories you tell yourself about your
situation in life. For instance, suppose something bad has happened in your life,
and your mind is telling you all kinds of things about how horrible it is. You
could be a victim of the attitude that inspires the ai expression, taai laeo, which
means, “I’m already dead!” Too many people react to situations in life that way.
You have to look at yourself to remind yourself that you’re not dead, you’re still
alive, and there are still things you can do. at helps to calm you down.
Some people object to the idea of developing equanimity in daily life because
it sounds like you’ll end up with no feeling or aﬀection for anybody, but that’s not
the case. You have to realize that as long as you feel the need to feed on other
people, there’s going to be emotional upset. e mind is going to be like a roller
coaster, and if your mind is like a roller coaster, you’re not in a good solid position
to help them. You would actually be more helpful to the people you love if you
could develop equanimity. You could view situations more objectively and come
from a more emotionally secure and steady place. at way, you’d be better
equipped to provide genuine help—as with the equanimity of a doctor. So, you
can still have aﬀection for others, and you can still be helpful to them even
though you develop equanimity.
As I noted earlier, the lowest level of equanimity covers everything from
equanimity in daily life up through the attainment of the third jhāna. What this
means in practice is that this is the equanimity you have to develop as you’re
learning to bring the mind into concentration. And here again, it has to be
combined with the right qualities, in the right balance, at the right time, in order
to be skillful.
For example, when the Buddha was rst teaching Rāhula, his son, how to
meditate, he started out with the instruction for Rāhula to make his mind like
earth: Just as earth isn’t upset when disgusting things are thrown on it, you
should try to train your mind not to let agreeable or disagreeable sense
impressions take charge of your mind. e purpose of this instruction, though, is


154

not simply to put the mind into a state of equanimity or acceptance. Instead, it’s
meant to act as a foundation for the more proactive steps of breath meditation. If
you’re going to train the mind to be skilled at fabricating a good state of
concentration, you rst have to train yourself to be a good observer, solid and
balanced, and that means not letting pleasant and unpleasant things take over the
mind to tip it out of balance. at way, when you make a mistake, you can see it
clearly and admit it. When you do something well, you’re in a position to gure
out how to put it to good use, rather than simply enjoying the immediate good
results.
So, equanimity in this case acts as a basis for persistence and discernment.
Now, as you’re trying to apply these lessons to get the mind into
concentration, the Buddha notes that there are times when equanimity, if it’s
emphasized at the wrong time, can be unskillful. For example, when he describes
the seven factors for awakening, he notes that three of the factors are skillful
when the mind has too much energy and three are skillful when it doesn’t have
enough. When the mind has too much energy, you need to develop the factors
that calm it: calm, concentration, and equanimity. You avoid the more energizing
factors, which include analysis of qualities—which is the activity of discernment
—persistence, and rapture. When the mind is sluggish, however, you develop the
energizing factors and avoid the more calming ones.
e Buddha gives an analogy of trying to control a re. If the re is too big,
you put water and ashes on it. As for the three more energizing factors, those are
like adding more fuel to the re. So, if there’s too much energy in your mind, then
equanimity is one of the factors that functions like water or ashes. But if you’re
sitting here falling asleep in the middle of your meditation, it’s not a time for
equanimity. It would be like putting ashes and water on a re that’s already
threatening to go out. So, there are times when equanimity is not what you want.
ere’s another passage where the Buddha makes a similar point about
equanimity and its role in meditation, where it’s more a matter of getting several
diﬀerent skillful qualities to work together at the same time. He says you have to
balance equanimity with concentration and persistence. If you develop just
concentration, the mind gets lazy. If you develop just persistence, the mind gets
restless. If you develop just equanimity, the mind doesn’t get concentrated. In
other words, if you just sit there watching things coming and going, coming and
going, nothing gets developed.


155

He compares this to the process of re ning gold. Persistence is like putting the
gold into the re, concentration is like blowing on it, and equanimity is like
simply watching it. So, imagine: If you just sit there watching the gold without
putting it into the re or doing anything to it, nothing happens. If you just put it
into the re without taking it out to blow on it or watch it, it burns up. If you just
blow on it, it stays cool—and there you are: nothing. So, as you’re working on
your meditation, you have to balance your equanimity with concentration and
persistence, getting them to work together as you re ne the state of your mind.
Now, even though we’re talking about equanimity in meditation, as long as we
haven’t reached the fourth jhāna, it still counts as worldly equanimity. It’s still
based on the determination not to react. As long as you can maintain that
determination, your equanimity will last, but if it lacks the nourishment of the
fourth jhāna, it can crumble pretty easily. Still, to reach the higher levels of
equanimity, you need to learn to develop this level of equanimity rst.
• e second level of equanimity, which the Buddha calls unworldly
equanimity, is the equanimity based on high levels of concentration, starting with
the fourth jhāna. e Buddha also calls this “equanimity based on singleness”
because it’s based on getting the mind solid in a state of oneness. is is stronger
than the rst level of equanimity because its foundation is stronger. is is
another area where the practice of jhāna enters into the perfections.
Now, even though this level of equanimity is more solid than the rst level, it,
too, can become unskillful if you simply let yourself rest content with it. ere’s a
passage where the Buddha talks about how this level of equanimity is not the goal
because we can still feed on it. We can still cling to it. You still need the
discernment to get past that kind of attachment, and it requires a certain amount
of persistence to get that discernment to work, because the second level of
equanimity is something extremely calm and extremely stable. Because it’s so
stable, it can make the mind lazy, which is why you have to energize your
discernment, your mindfulness, and your persistence—in other words, right view,
right mindfulness, and right eﬀort—to act on the realization that “I have to let go
of this attachment, too.”
is is another example of how equanimity needs to be teamed with other
skillful qualities in order to stay skillful. It also shows how the diﬀerent
perfections have to work together, and how we need all the perfections and not
just one or two: Equanimity helps give our persistence and discernment some


156

stamina, but at the same time, persistence and discernment have to check
equanimity to make sure we’re not getting stuck on a lower level. Without these
two perfections, equanimity can make you lazy, and it’s very easy to tell yourself,
“ is is it, this is it, this is all I need. My mind is calm; my mind is stable.” So, you
have to be very watchful.
• e third level of equanimity is the equanimity based on awakening. e
Buddha calls this “even more unworldly unworldly equanimity.” is level of
equanimity is a by-product of awakening, but it’s not a characteristic of
awakening itself. Awakening itself is the highest happiness. e equanimity that
follows on awakening comes when you re ect on how you are now free from
passion, aversion, and delusion. is realization can give rise to equanimity
because this level of happiness is not based on conditions and so cannot be
aﬀected by anything. at means that this equanimity cannot be shaken by
anything at all. It’s emotionally stable with regard to anything else. However, this
realization can also give rise to strong pleasure and rapture, so here, too, is a case
where skillful equanimity does not occur alone.
It’s important to note that this equanimity does not get in the way of
compassion. In fact, quite the contrary: Now that your desire for true happiness
has succeeded and your own needs have been met, you can turn your energies to
helping others with no need to feed on them. is is why the Buddha places so
much emphasis on solving the problem of your own suﬀering and your tendency
to feed. Your motivations with regard to yourself and others can now be totally
pure.
Now, this third level of equanimity is not something that can be done. In
other words, it’s not part of the path. It’s something that comes as a result. is is
an important distinction to make. All too o en we hear that awakened people
have lots of equanimity, so we decide, “I’m going to have equanimity. And there
we are!” But that kind of willed equanimity would be nothing more than worldly
equanimity, the lowest level of equanimity. It’s nothing more than an attempt to
clone awakening, but awakening can’t be cloned. It requires you to follow all the
steps of the path and develop all the factors of the path. en, when the path has
been fully developed and is yielding its results, that’s when the highest level of
equanimity will appear—and, as the ajaans all say, it’s totally unlike the rst two
levels of equanimity.



157

Ajaan Maha Boowa tells a story about his own practice. He got his mind into
a very strong level of concentration and it got to the point where it didn’t seem to
change at all. At rst, he was convinced, “ is must be it. is must be
awakening.” But then he began to notice that that level of equanimity and peace
still had its subtle ups and downs. It still had to be tended to. Finally, he realized,
“ is can’t be it. If this were unconditioned, it wouldn’t have any ups and downs,
it wouldn’t have to be tended to.” Only when he was able to let go of his
attachment to that state of concentration was he able to step back from it, analyze
it, and then come to true awakening. And—excuse me for this image—he said
that although he originally thought that that earlier state of concentration was so
wonderful, when he found true awakening and compared the two, he said the
concentration was like excrement, only he used a more impolite word. It’s for this
reason that he was very strict with his students. And it’s also for this reason that
we should be strict with ourselves. Don’t allow yourself to rest content when
there’s something better to be attained. Keep developing your discernment,
persistence, and renunciation. You’ll be glad you did.

QUESTIONS

Q: What is the diﬀerence between upekkhā, equanimity, and adukkham-
asukhaṁ, a neutral feeling?
A: e diﬀerence is that upekkhā has to do with the emotions. A neutral
feeling is simply the feeling tone of a sensation, physical or mental. Equanimity
has more to do with mental and emotional stability.

Q: Contentment is hard for me, the idea of accepting things just as they are.
What should I do?
A: e Buddha didn’t teach you to accept things as they are in all cases. is is
where it’s important to understand his teachings on kamma. Everything we
experience in the present moment is a combination of three factors. e rst
factor consists of the results of past intentions. ese could be intentions from
just the moment before to lifetimes before, ripening now in the present moment.
e second factor is your present intentions. e third is the result of your
present intentions. You can’t do much about the results of your past intentions,
but you can change your present intentions and their results.


158

So, the things you have to content yourself with are the things that come from
past kamma. But even then, the simple fact that your past kamma up to now has,
say, given bad results doesn’t mean that it has to keep on giving bad results. You
can change your present intentions freely. is is why the Buddha said that we
don’t have to suﬀer even from the results of past bad actions. If we master skillful
intentions in the present moment, we can keep the mind from suﬀering even in
bad situations. So, content yourself with things you cannot change, but don’t
content yourself with things you can change and need to be improved. A lot of
discernment will lie in guring out which is which.
e Buddha taught that, as a meditator, you should content yourself with
outside conditions if they’re good enough for you to practice in. But as long as
you’re still suﬀering, you should not content yourself with the level of skill in your
own mind. In fact, the Buddha said that was the secret to his awakening: As long
as there was a further skill that he could still develop, he would not rest content.

Q: ere are those who I like, those who I don’t like. I have my preferences.
Equanimity to me seems like a utopia. Please comment.
A: Equanimity doesn’t mean not having likes or dislikes. It simply means not
letting your likes and dislikes take over the mind. It basically comes down to the
fact that certain things in life you can change and certain things you cannot. You
need to have equanimity about the things you cannot change so that you have the
strength and energy to work on the things that you can change and improve.
When they say that the Great Way is not diﬃcult for those with no preferences,
what they mean is that you have to be willing to do whatever the Great Way
requires. If it requires observing the precepts, then you observe the precepts. If it
requires learning how to concentrate the mind, then you concentrate the mind.
You prefer following the path to not following the path, but you don’t let other
preferences get in the way of actually following the path.

DAY TEN
MORNING

Conclusion
Before the Buddha’s awakening, he had a vision. He saw the world as a small
puddle of water full of sh ghting one another over the water. ose that lost
the battle died, but all those that won the battle died as well. As he looked around
at the world, he couldn’t see anything that wasn’t already laid claim to, which
meant, of course, that if he was going to nd happiness in the world, he would
have to ght somebody else oﬀ, just like the sh. It gave rise to a strong sense of
dismay and discontent.
en, he said, he looked inside and he saw that the whole problem came from
an arrow, there in the heart. It was the arrow of desire and craving. He realized
that if you could remove the arrow, there would be no more suﬀering. So, he
committed himself to nding a way to pull that arrow out. He found that the
path to pulling it out required desire as well: the desire to put an end to desire. It
didn’t work simply to say, “Don’t have any more desires.” Instead, it rst required
determination to give priority to skillful desires over unskillful desires.
In general, this ability to give priority to some desires over others in a
systematic way is a sign of maturity. It requires determination. In fact, that’s what
determination is: the desire to give consistent priority to your most valuable
desires. Now, the Buddha’s determination in particular was that he not rest
content until he had found something that didn’t die. He realized that this
determination would require that he negotiate with death. In other words, he
realized that when death came, there would be many things he would have to give
up if he wanted to arrive at the deathless. at meant devoting his life to nding
the things that would be of value even a er death occurred.
He conveyed this determination in an analogy he described to King Pasenadi.
One time, King Pasenadi came in the middle of the day to see the Buddha. e
Buddha asked him, “What have you been doing today?” e king, in a
remarkable display of frankness, said, “All the typical things that a person
obsessed with power would be doing.” Can you imagine our political leaders


160

being frank enough to say that now? So, the Buddha said to the king, “Suppose
someone trustworthy came from the east and said, ‘ ere’s a mountain moving in
from the east, as tall as the sky, crushing all living beings in its path.’ Suppose
another trustworthy person came from the south, saying, ‘ ere’s a mountain
moving in from the south, as tall as the sky, crushing all living beings in its way.’”
Similarly from the west and the north—in other words, four huge mountains
moving in from all sides. e Buddha asked the king, “Given this danger, this
horrible destruction of life, and given that human birth is rare, what would you
do?” e king replied, “What else could I do except calm my mind and practice
the Dhamma?” en the Buddha said, “I tell you, aging, illness, and death are
moving in, crushing all living beings in their path. So, what are you going to do?”
And the king said, “What else can I do but calm the mind and practice the
Dhamma?” at’s what skillful determination is about: focusing your mind,
focusing your desires, on things that will be of value even in the face of death.
e perfections are the qualities of heart and mind needed to carry through
with that determination.
You notice, as you look at the list of perfections, that they give priority to the
state of your heart and mind. And more: ey give purpose to the heart and
mind. A er all, the nature of the heart and mind is that they need to have
purpose and can’t be happy unless the purpose is good. By aiming your desires at a
happiness that doesn’t change and gives no harm, you’re giving the heart and
mind the best purpose of all.
As you look at the list of perfections, you notice two more things.
• One is that they develop qualities of both a good mind and a good heart.
When we talk about a good mind, we usually mean someone who has
discernment, someone who has a wise purpose in mind and is intelligent in
bringing them about. is sort of discernment requires an understanding of cause
and eﬀect, not only in the abstract but also in its practical application. ink of
the Buddha’s instructions to his son, that he examine not only his intentions for
acting, but also the actual results of his actions. A person with a truly good mind
is willing to learn from his mistakes to increase his skill in arriving at good ends.
Remember the candidates at the brain surgery school. Really smart people are
those who are active in recognizing a mistake and trying to correct it.
As for the qualities of a good heart, those basically have to do with your will,
which aims not only at your own happiness, but also at the happiness of others.


161

is covers the perfections of goodwill and giving. But a good heart does more
than aim at happiness. It also needs the strength to carry through with its aims,
regardless of the diﬃculties it encounters. ink of the man pinned down by
bandits who are sawing his limbs oﬀ. For him to feel goodwill for them in an
extreme situation like that, he needs to have developed more than goodwill. He
needs to have developed the other perfections—qualities like truth, virtue,
persistence, giving, renunciation, endurance, and equanimity—to provide the
strength so that good intentions lead to good realities. is means that a truly
good heart is not only well-meaning, generous, and kind. It’s also strong in
sticking to its skillful intentions.
• is relates to the second point, which is that these perfections are aimed at
nding a true happiness, but in the course of developing that true happiness, you
also have to be truly good. is means that your pursuit of happiness and the
pursuit of goodness are basically the same thing. ere doesn’t have to be a
con ict between the two. Whatever con ict there is between the heart and the
mind becomes settled. e practice of the perfections helps to make the heart and
the mind into one.
ey become one because we give clear priority to our most skillful desires:
at’s the function of skillful determination. Now, remember the four
determinations that the Buddha taught, which are basically the four desires to
which he would have you give priority. e four are:
• not to neglect discernment,
• to guard the truth,
• to be devoted to relinquishment, and
• to train for calm.
So, let’s look again at those four determinations.
e rst determination includes the perfections of discernment and goodwill.
As you will remember, the Buddha’s discernment is strategic. It’s concerned less
with the nature of things and more with the nature of your actions, focused on
how to direct your actions so that they give the results you want. is requires an
understanding of cause and eﬀect, and of how to use that understanding in order
to bring about true happiness. is is how discernment and goodwill work
together.




162

Right view always carries duties if you wish well for yourself and others. e
duty with regard to the rst noble truth, which is suﬀering, is to comprehend it.
e duty with regard to the second noble truth, the cause of suﬀering, is to
abandon it. You should try to realize the cessation of suﬀering, which is done by
developing the path to the end of suﬀering.
Of these four noble truths, the third is the most important, because it’s the
goal to which the practice aims. Always keep in mind that it is possible to put an
end to suﬀering. All too o en we let ourselves get distracted by other messages.
We’re told that true happiness is not possible, so we should content ourselves
with lesser pleasures. at’s what the world economy is based on—which means
that the economy is based on keeping you within its limits. is is why it’s almost
an act of de ance to allow yourself to imagine that true happiness is possible. is
is what it means not to neglect discernment: to keep in mind the possibility that
true happiness can be found as a result of your own eﬀorts, so you should always
choose your actions in light of what their long-term results will be.
is leads into the second of the determinations, which is to guard the truth.
Once you’ve made up your mind that you have a goal, you want to be true in
doing whatever needs to be done to attain that goal. Now, there is a seeming
paradox here in the practice, in that we have to learn to guard the truth but at the
same time we have to learn how not to be attached to views about the truth. But
it’s not really a paradox. It’s a matter of strategy.
Remember the four diﬀerent kinds of truth: the truth of person, in other
words, your ability to stick with something that you really believe is right; the
truth of perceptions; the truth of statements; and the truth of facts, in and of
themselves. Now, the rst and the last are the ones that you never abandon until
the very end of the path. As for the truth of statements and perceptions, there are
statements that give us a true idea of what would be a good way to practice and
there are statements that give us the wrong idea, so you have to make a clear
distinction. To guard the truth, you have to keep reminding yourself that you are
acting on conviction as you follow the Buddha’s recommendations as to which
statements about suﬀering are true, so you have to hold on to them skillfully: not
for the sake of defeating other people in argument, but for the sake of nding out
whether or not they give true results.
Remember the image of the ra . You’re going across the river and you have to
hold on to the ra . Otherwise you get swept away. But you realize that the ra


163

itself is not the goal, it’s a means to get you to the goal. Once you get to the goal,
then you can let go of the ra because you’ve arrived at the truth of the fact that
you were hoping for. at’s what it means to be unattached to views. But make
sure you don’t let go of right views before you get to the other side of the river.
Simply be conscious of the fact that these are things that you hold on to because
of conviction, so you’re not yet 100% sure. You’ll know for sure when you reach
the other shore.
Truth requires trying to nd a reliable teacher, being truthful in judging the
teacher, and then being true in sticking to the path even though it’s demanding.
All three of these actions require that you be true as well. To learn the truth, you
have to be true. When you’re consistently true in this way, it allows you to reach
the truth that is a fact, beyond the truth of perceptions and statements.
Now, this quality of truth is found in the perfections of truth, virtue, and
persistence. With the perfection of virtue, we’re faced with a paradox similar to
that of the perfection of truth. In other words, there are the precepts that
correspond to right speech and right action, but we’re sometimes told not to hold
on to precepts and practices. Here again, though, the issue is strategic. You
practice the precepts and stick to them, being mindful and alert to remember
them and apply them in your actions, but once they become qualities of your
heart, then you don’t have to keep reminding yourself of the precepts because the
quality of truth and virtue is now a part of your heart. You don’t have to hold on
to the words. You’ve got the reality of virtue within you.
As for persistence, this is a matter not only of abandoning or letting go of
things. ere are altogether four types of right eﬀort: trying to prevent unskillful
states from arising, to abandon unskillful states if they have arisen, to give rise to
skillful states that have not arisen, and then to maintain and develop them when
they have. We need the quality of calm—endurance and equanimity—to
maintain our stamina as we pursue these four eﬀorts. ese eﬀorts also require
taking joy in being on the path, so that when we’re confronted with challenges,
we don’t see them as problems. We see them as opportunities. is depends on
our ability to develop the perfection of discernment to keep ourselves motivated
on the path.
e third desire in determination is to be devoted to relinquishment. is
covers the perfections of giving and renunciation. In both cases, you regard giving



164

and renunciation of sensuality as a trade up: ere are certain things you’ll have
to sacri ce, but you’ll gain things of greater value in return.
Giving covers not only giving material items away, but also giving your energy,
your time, your knowledge, and your forgiveness. In return, you gain a much
broader mind and heart, a sense of spaciousness and self-esteem.
In a similar way, the perfection of renunciation is not simply a matter of giving
up sensual pleasures and sensual thoughts. You’re opening the way to an
alternative pleasure that’s higher than sensual pleasures. In mastering the pleasure
of concentration, you take yourself out of the back-and-forth between trying to
run away from pains and running towards sensual pleasures. You remember the
image of the hell of beings trapped in a aming cube, in which you keep running
toward the door you think will lead to pleasure and it immediately gets shut in
your face. But when you nally do get through the door, you fall into another
hell.
When you practice concentration, you get yourself out of that situation. You
change your relationship to pleasure and pain. Instead of having to run toward
sensual pleasure to get away from pain, you put yourself in a position of strength
where you can learn how to use pleasure and to use pain. You can use pain to
develop your discernment into the process of fabrication in your mind. You can
use the pleasure of concentration to give yourself a foundation where you can
continue to look deeper and deeper into the mind, to see its fabrications on more
and more subtle levels. is is how you put yourself onto the path of the middle
way.
e fourth and nal of the desires of determination is to train only for calm.
Now, calm here functions in two ways. On the one hand, it’s the goal to which
you aim; on the other hand, it’s a means to help give you stamina on the path to
that goal.
e two perfections coming under calm are endurance and equanimity.
In developing endurance, we have to learn what to tolerate and what not to
tolerate. e things we have to learn how to tolerate are harsh words and painful
feelings. As we pointed out, learning how to tolerate or endure these things
requires that we use all three kinds of fabrication—bodily, verbal, and mental—
and that we cultivate a sense of humor that makes light of our diﬃculties.




165

e things you have to learn not to tolerate are unskillful states that arise in
the mind. You don’t just accept them and stay with them or simply note their
presence. You have to gure out some way to get them out of the mind, using
whatever strategy you nd will work.
As for equanimity, it’s the ability not to weigh ourselves down with
unnecessary emotional baggage. ere are three levels of equanimity in all. e
ability simply to be indiﬀerent when things happen is the lowest level of
equanimity. Higher than that is the equanimity of the mind in the fourth jhāna
and the formless attainments, and higher still there’s the equanimity that comes
as a result of release. e rst two levels of equanimity play a role in the path. e
third level comes about as a result of attaining the goal. Now, we can’t clone that
last level of equanimity. We have to develop the rst two levels, remembering that
equanimity is useful on the path as a means of enabling us to carry through with
the perfection of persistence. So, don’t let your equanimity make you lazy.
Remember the equanimity of a doctor. You maintain your goodwill, you
maintain your compassion, you accept what cannot be changed, and that frees up
your energy to focus on what can be changed. Also, remember the equanimity of
a soldier, which is that in spite of hardships and setbacks, you maintain your
determination to come out victorious. In that way, your equanimity is combined
with other skillful qualities so that it doesn’t get in the way of your goal. It
actually becomes the basis for which you can nd your way beyond the hardships
and setbacks to come out winning.
Above all, don’t fall for the equanimity of resignation, telling yourself, “ is is
all there is in life, so I have to accept it.” at’s basically trying to nd happiness
by lowering your standards. It’s a defeatist attitude. e Buddha’s message is just
the opposite: You nd happiness by giving yourself good standards and then
raising them. In other words, keep on remembering the message of discernment,
which is to hold to the view that the total end of suﬀering is possible. It is possible
to win in the ght against suﬀering.
So, that’s the Buddha’s advice: that true happiness is possible and it’s found by
also developing true goodness in your own heart and mind. So, don’t give up,
keep up your eﬀort, take joy in the practice and in encountering challenges, and
don’t rest content with these perfections until they’ve brought you to the goal. In
other words, don’t sell yourself short. Don’t set your price too low.

As the Buddha himself developed these perfections, there came a point, of
course, where he had to let them go. In fact, at the moment of awakening, he had
to let everything go. But as Ajaan Lee would o en point out, that didn’t mean
those things ran away from him. He still had those qualities le over to help him
in his work of teaching the religion.
We can see the results of these perfections in the qualities that he displayed as
a Buddha. e three main qualities are discernment, compassion, and purity. His
discernment was developed by the perfections of discernment, renunciation,
equanimity, and goodwill. His compassion was developed by his perfections of
goodwill, generosity, endurance, and virtue. And his purity was developed by the
perfections of virtue, truthfulness, determination, endurance, and persistence.
When you follow these principles, you’re fully exercising the power of your
mind and your heart. is gives purpose to your life, ful lling one of the basic
needs of the mind and the heart, which is to have a good purpose. Only when you
have a coherent purpose, a good purpose, through developing the perfection of
determination, can the mind and the heart be deeply happy. And, following the
Buddha, you give yourself the best possible purpose, which is to focus on a
genuine happiness, a genuine goodness, which is blameless and unchanging.
Deathless. is purpose will carry over even a er you leave this life, and
eventually you’ll be able to pursue this desire until you reach the end of desire.
e end of desire doesn’t come by denying your desires. It comes when you
reach a happiness so satisfying that you no longer have any need to feed. In the
meantime, you can take heart in the fact that your search for genuine happiness is
at the same time a search for genuine goodness, and that someday you will arrive
at what you are searching for. But this path doesn’t save all of its rewards until the
end. You’ll nd that your happiness and your goodness will become more and
more solid all along the way. is will be good for you and for everyone else you
encounter.

§1.   ree types of discernment:
discernment from listening (sutamaya-paññā)
discernment from thinking (cintāmaya-paññā)
discernment from developing/meditation (bhāvanāmaya-paññā) — DN 33

§2. “ is is the way leading to discernment: when visiting a contemplative or
brahman, to ask, ‘What is skillful, venerable sir? What is unskillful? What is
blameworthy? What is blameless? What should be cultivated? What should not
be cultivated? What, having been done by me, will be for my long-term harm &
suﬀering? Or what, having been done by me, will be for my long-term welfare &
happiness?’” — MN 135


168

§3. Mundane right view: “ ere is what is given, what is oﬀered, what is
sacri ced. ere are fruits & results of good & bad actions. ere is this world &
the next world. ere is mother & father. ere are spontaneously reborn beings;
there are contemplatives & brahmans who, faring rightly & practicing rightly,
proclaim this world & the next a er having directly known & realized it for
themselves.” — MN 117

§4. Phenomena are
preceded by the heart,
ruled by the heart,
made of the heart.
If you speak or act
with a corrupted heart,
then suﬀering follows you—
as the wheel of the cart,
the track of the ox
that pulls it.
Phenomena are
preceded by the heart,
ruled by the heart,
made of the heart.
If you speak or act
with a calm, bright heart,
then happiness follows you,
like a shadow
that never leaves. — Dhp 1–2

§5. “And what is right view? Knowledge in terms of stress, knowledge in terms
of the origination of stress, knowledge in terms of the cessation of stress,
knowledge in terms of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress: is is
called right view.
“And what is right resolve? Resolve for renunciation, for non- ill will, & for
harmlessness: is is called right resolve.” — SN 45:8




169

§6. “‘ is noble truth of stress is to be comprehended’ … ‘ is noble truth of
the origination of stress is to be abandoned’ … ‘ is noble truth of the cessation
of stress is to be realized’ … ‘ is noble truth of the way of practice leading to the
cessation of stress is to be developed.’” — SN 56:11

§7. “As for the course of action that is unpleasant to do but that, when done,
leads to what is pro table, it is in light of this course of action that one may be
known—in terms of manly stamina, manly persistence, manly eﬀort—as a fool or
a wise person. For a fool doesn’t re ect, ‘Even though this course of action is
unpleasant to do, still when it is done it leads to what is pro table.’ So he doesn’t
do it, and thus the non-doing of that course of action leads to what is unpro table
for him. But a wise person re ects, ‘Even though this course of action is
unpleasant to do, still when it is done it leads to what is pro table.’ So he does it,
and thus the doing of that course of action leads to what is pro table for him.
“As for the course of action that is pleasant to do but that, when done, leads to
what is unpro table, it is in light of this course of action that one may be known
—in terms of manly stamina, manly persistence, manly eﬀort—as a fool or a wise
person. For a fool doesn’t re ect, ‘Even though this course of action is pleasant to

done it leads to what is unpro table.’ So he doesn’t do it, and thus the non-doing
of that course of action leads to what is pro table for him.” — AN 4:115

§8. What does discernment come from? You might compare it with learning
to become a potter, a tailor, or a basket weaver. e teacher will start out by
telling you how to make a pot, sew a shirt or a pair of pants, or weave diﬀerent
patterns, but the proportions and beauty of the object you make will have to
depend on your own powers of observation. Suppose you weave a basket and then
take a good look at its proportions, to see if it’s too short or too tall. If it’s too
short, weave another one, a little taller, and then take a good look at it to see if
there’s anything that still needs improving, to see if it’s too thin or too fat. en
weave another one, better-looking than the last. Keep this up until you have one
that’s as beautiful and well-proportioned as possible, one with nothing to criticize




170

from any angle. is last basket you can take as your standard. You can now set
yourself up in business.
What you’ve done is to learn from your own actions. As for your previous
eﬀorts, you needn’t concern yourself with them any longer. row them out. is
is a sense of discernment that arises of its own accord, an ingenuity and sense of
judgment that come not from anything your teachers have taught you, but from
observing and evaluating on your own the object that you yourself have made.
e same holds true in practicing meditation. For discernment to arise, you
have to be observant as you keep track of the breath and to gain a sense of how to
adjust and improve it so that it’s well-proportioned throughout the body—to the
point where it ows evenly without faltering, so that it’s comfortable in slow and
out slow, in fast and out fast, long, short, heavy, or re ned. Get so that both the
in-breath and the out-breath are comfortable no matter what way you breathe, so
that—no matter when—you immediately feel a sense of ease the moment you
focus on the breath. When you can do this, physical results will appear: a sense of
ease and lightness, open and spacious. e body will be strong, the breath and
blood will ow unobstructed and won’t form an opening for disease to step in.
e body will be healthy and awake.
As for the mind, when mindfulness and alertness are the causes, a still mind is
the result. When negligence is the cause, a mind distracted and restless is the
result. So we must try to make the causes good, in order to give rise to the good
results we’ve referred to. If we use our powers of observation and evaluation in
caring for the breath, and are constantly correcting and improving it, we’ll
develop awareness on our own, the fruit of having developed our concentration
higher step by step. — Phra Ajaan Lee: Inner Strength

§9. People with discernment will see that stress is of two kinds: (1) physical
stress, or the inherent stress of natural conditions; and (2) mental stress, or the
stress of de lement.…
Aging, illness, and death are simply the shadows of stress and not its true
substance. People lacking discernment will try to do away with the shadows,
which leads only to more suﬀering and stress. is is because they aren’t
acquainted with what the shadows and substance of stress come from. e
essence of stress lies with the mind. Aging, illness, and death are its shadows or
eﬀects that show by way of the body. When we want to kill our enemy and so take


171

a knife to stab his shadow, how is he going to die? In the same way, ignorant
people try to destroy the shadows of stress and don’t get anywhere. As for the
essence of stress in the heart, they don’t think of remedying it at all. is lack of
awareness on their part is one form of avijjā, or ignorance. — Phra Ajaan Lee:
Inner Strength


Goodwill

§10. All
tremble at the rod,
all
are fearful of death.
Drawing the parallel to
yourself,
neither kill nor get others to kill. — Dhp 129

§11. ink: “Happy, at rest,
may all beings be happy at heart.
Whatever beings there may be,
weak or strong, without exception,
long, large,
middling, short,
subtle, blatant,
seen & unseen,
near & far,
born & seeking birth:
May all beings be happy at heart.
Let no one deceive another
or despise anyone anywhere,
or through anger or resistance
wish for another to suﬀer.”
As a mother would risk her life
to protect her child, her only child,
even so should one cultivate the heart limitlessly
with regard to all beings. — Sn 1:8


172

§12. “‘May these beings—free from animosity, free from oppression, and free
from trouble—look a er themselves with ease.’” — AN 10:176

§13. “Suppose that a man were to drop a salt crystal into a small amount of
water in a cup. What do you think? Would the water in the cup become salty
because of the salt crystal, and un t to drink?”
“Yes, lord. Why is that? ere being only a small amount of water in the cup,
it would become salty because of the salt crystal, and un t to drink.”
“Now, suppose that a man were to drop a salt crystal into the River Ganges.
What do you think? Would the water in the River Ganges become salty because
of the salt crystal, and un t to drink?”
“No, lord. Why is that? ere being a great mass of water in the River Ganges,
it would not become salty because of the salt crystal or un t to drink.”
“In the same way, there is the case where a tri ing evil deed done by one
individual (the rst) takes him to hell; and there is the case where the very same
sort of tri ing deed done by the other individual is experienced in the here &
now, and for the most part barely appears for a moment.
“Now, a tri ing evil deed done by what sort of individual takes him to hell?
ere is the case where a certain individual is undeveloped in body [i.e., pleasure
can invade his mind and remain there], undeveloped in virtue, undeveloped in
mind [i.e., pain can invade his mind and remain there], undeveloped in
discernment: restricted, small-hearted, dwelling with suﬀering. A tri ing evil
deed done by this sort of individual takes him to hell.
“Now, a tri ing evil deed done by what sort of individual is experienced in the
here & now, and for the most part barely appears for a moment? ere is the case
where a certain individual is developed in body, developed in virtue, developed in
mind, developed in discernment: unrestricted, large-hearted, dwelling with the
immeasurable. A tri ing evil deed done by this sort of individual is experienced in
the here & now, and for the most part barely appears for a moment.” — AN
3:101

§14. “Monks, for one whose awareness-release through goodwill is cultivated,
developed, pursued, given a means of transport, given a grounding, steadied,
consolidated, and well-undertaken, eleven rewards can be expected. Which
eleven?

173

“One sleeps easily, wakes easily, dreams no evil dreams. One is dear to human
beings, dear to non-human beings. e devas protect one. Neither re, poison,
nor weapons can touch one. One’s mind gains concentration quickly. One’s
complexion is bright. One dies unconfused and—if penetrating no higher—is
headed for a Brahmā world.” — AN 11:16

II. TRUTH

§15. “Let an observant person come—one who is not fraudulent, not
deceitful, one of a straightforward nature. I instruct him. I teach him the
Dhamma. Practicing as instructed, he in no long time knows for himself, sees for
himself: ‘So this is how there is the right liberation from bondage, i.e., the
bondage of ignorance.’” — MN 80

§16. Kāpadika Bhāradvāja: “But to what extent, Master Gotama, is there the
guarding of the truth? To what extent does one guard the truth? We ask Master
Gotama about the guarding of the truth.”
e Buddha: “If a person has conviction, his statement, ‘ is is my
conviction,’ guards the truth. But he doesn’t yet come to the de nite conclusion
that ‘Only this is true; anything else is worthless.’ To this extent, Bhāradvāja, there
is the guarding of the truth. To this extent one guards the truth. I describe this as
the guarding of the truth. But it is not yet an awakening to the truth.
“If a person likes something… holds an unbroken tradition… has something
reasoned through analogy… has something he agrees to, having pondered views,
his statement, ‘ is is what I agree to, having pondered views,’ guards the truth.
But he doesn’t yet come to the de nite conclusion that ‘Only this is true;
anything else is worthless.’ To this extent, Bhāradvāja, there is the guarding of the
truth. To this extent one guards the truth. I describe this as the guarding of the
truth. But it is not yet an awakening to the truth.”
“Y es, Master Gotama, to this extent there is the guarding of the truth. To this
extent one guards the truth. We regard this as the guarding of the truth. But to
what extent is there an awakening to the truth? To what extent does one awaken
to the truth? We ask Master Gotama about awakening to the truth.”
“ ere is the case, Bhāradvāja, where a monk lives in dependence on a certain
village or town. en a householder or householder’s son goes to him and


174

observes him with regard to three mental qualities—qualities based on greed,
qualities based on aversion, qualities based on delusion: ‘Are there in this
venerable one any such qualities based on greed that, with his mind overcome by
these qualities, he might say, “I know,” while not knowing, or say, “I see,” while
not seeing; or that he might urge another to act in a way that was for his/her
long-term harm & pain?’ As he observes him, he comes to know, ‘ ere are in
this venerable one no such qualities based on greed.… His bodily behavior &
verbal behavior are those of one not greedy. And the Dhamma he teaches is deep,
hard to see, hard to realize, tranquil, re ned, beyond the scope of conjecture,
subtle, to-be-experienced by the wise. is Dhamma can’t easily be taught by a
person who’s greedy.
“When, on observing that the monk is puri ed with regard to qualities based
on greed, he next observes him with regard to qualities based on aversion … based
on delusion: ‘Are there in this venerable one any such qualities based on delusion
that, with his mind overcome by these qualities, he might say, “I know,” while not
knowing, or say, “I see,” while not seeing; or that he might urge another to act in a
way that was for his/her long-term harm & pain?’ As he observes him, he comes
to know, ‘ ere are in this venerable one no such qualities based on delusion.…
His bodily behavior & verbal behavior are those of one not deluded. And the
Dhamma he teaches is deep, hard to see, hard to realize, tranquil, re ned, beyond
the scope of conjecture, subtle, to-be-experienced by the wise. is Dhamma can’t
easily be taught by a person who’s deluded.
“When, on observing that the monk is puri ed with regard to qualities based
on delusion, he places conviction in him. With the arising of conviction, he visits
him & grows close to him. Growing close to him, he lends ear. Lending ear, he
hears the Dhamma. Hearing the Dhamma, he remembers it. Remembering it, he
penetrates the meaning of those dhammas. Penetrating the meaning, he comes to
an agreement through pondering those dhammas. ere being an agreement
through pondering those dhammas, desire arises. With the arising of desire, he
becomes willing. Willing, he contemplates [literally: weighs, compares].
Contemplating, he makes an exertion. Exerting himself, he both realizes the
ultimate meaning of the truth with his body and sees by penetrating it with
discernment.
“To this extent, Bhāradvāja, there is an awakening to the truth. To this extent
one awakens to the truth. I describe this as an awakening to the truth. But it is


175

not yet the nal attainment of the truth.”
“Yes, Master Gotama, to this extent there is an awakening to the truth. To this
extent one awakens to the truth. We regard this as an awakening to the truth. But
to what extent is there the nal attainment of the truth? To what extent does one
nally attain the truth? We ask Master Gotama about the nal attainment of the
truth.”
“ e cultivation, development, & pursuit of those very same qualities: to this
extent, Bhāradvāja, there is the nal attainment of the truth. To this extent one
nally attains the truth. I describe this as the nal attainment of the truth.” —
MN 95
§17. “Whatever is seen or heard or sensed
and fastened onto as true by others,
One who is Such—among the self-fettered—
would not further claim to be true or even false.
“Having seen well in advance that arrow
where generations are fastened & hung
—‘I know, I see, that’s just how it is!’—
there’s nothing of the Tathāgata fastened.” — AN 4:24


Virtue

§18. “Now, there are these ve gi s, ve great gi s—original, long-standing,
traditional, ancient, unadulterated, unadulterated from the beginning—that are
not open to suspicion, will never be open to suspicion, and are unfaulted by
knowledgeable contemplatives & brahmans. Which ve?
“ ere is the case where a disciple of the noble ones, abandoning the taking of
life, abstains from taking life. In doing so, he gives freedom from danger, freedom
from animosity, freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beings. In
giving freedom from danger, freedom from animosity, freedom from oppression
to limitless numbers of beings, he gains a share in limitless freedom from danger,
freedom from animosity, and freedom from oppression. is is the rst gi , the
rst great gi —original, long-standing, traditional, ancient, unadulterated,
unadulterated from the beginning—that is not open to suspicion, will never be



176

open to suspicion, and is unfaulted by knowledgeable contemplatives &
brahmans.”
[Similarly with the four remaining precepts: abandoning taking what is not
given (stealing), abandoning sexual misconduct, abandoning lying, abandoning
the use of intoxicants.] — AN 8:39

§19. “Monks, the taking of life—when indulged in, developed, & pursued—is
something that leads to hell, leads to rebirth as a common animal, leads to the
realm of the hungry ghosts. e slightest of all the results coming from the taking
of life is that, when one becomes a human being, it leads to a short life span.
“Stealing—when indulged in, developed, & pursued—is something that leads
to hell, leads to rebirth as a common animal, leads to the realm of the hungry
ghosts. e slightest of all the results coming from stealing is that, when one
becomes a human being, it leads to the loss of one’s wealth.
“Sexual misconduct—when indulged in, developed, & pursued—is
something that leads to hell, leads to rebirth as a common animal, leads to the
realm of the hungry ghosts. e slightest of all the results coming from sexual
misconduct is that, when one becomes a human being, it leads to rivalry &
revenge.
“Telling lies—when indulged in, developed, & pursued—is something that
leads to hell, leads to rebirth as a common animal, leads to the realm of the
hungry ghosts. e slightest of all the results coming from telling lies is that,
when one becomes a human being, it leads to being falsely accused.
“Divisive speech—when indulged in, developed, & pursued—is something
that leads to hell, leads to rebirth as a common animal, leads to the realm of the
hungry ghosts. e slightest of all the results coming from divisive speech is that,
when one becomes a human being, it leads to the breaking of one’s friendships.
“Harsh speech—when indulged in, developed, & pursued—is something that
leads to hell, leads to rebirth as a common animal, leads to the realm of the
hungry ghosts. e slightest of all the results coming from harsh speech is that,
when one becomes a human being, it leads to unappealing sounds.
“Idle chatter—when indulged in, developed, & pursued—is something that
leads to hell, leads to rebirth as a common animal, leads to the realm of the
hungry ghosts. e slightest of all the results coming from idle chatter is that,


177

when one becomes a human being, it leads to words that aren’t worth taking to
heart.
“ e drinking of fermented & distilled liquors—when indulged in,
developed, & pursued—is something that leads to hell, leads to rebirth as a
common animal, leads to the realm of the hungry ghosts. e slightest of all the
results coming from drinking fermented & distilled liquors is that, when one
becomes a human being, it leads to mental derangement.” — AN 8:40

§20. “And how is one an individual who practices for his own bene t and for
that of others? ere is the case where a certain individual himself abstains from
the taking of life and encourages others in undertaking abstinence from the
taking of life. He himself abstains from stealing and encourages others in
undertaking abstinence from stealing. He himself abstains from sexual
misconduct and encourages others in undertaking abstinence from sexual
misconduct. He himself abstains from lying and encourages others in
undertaking abstinence from lying. He himself abstains from intoxicants that
cause heedlessness and encourages others in undertaking abstinence from
intoxicants that cause heedlessness. Such is the individual who practices for his
own bene t and for that of others.” — AN 4:99

§21. “Monks, there are these ve kinds of loss. Which ve? Loss of relatives,
loss of wealth, loss through disease, loss in terms of virtue, loss in terms of views.
It’s not by reason of loss of relatives, loss of wealth, or loss through disease that
beings—with the break-up of the body, a er death—reappear in a plane of
deprivation, a bad destination, a lower realm, hell. It’s by reason of loss in terms of
virtue and loss in terms of views that beings—with the break-up of the body, a er
death—reappear in a plane of deprivation, a bad destination, a lower realm, hell.”
— AN 5:130


Persistence

§22. “And what is right eﬀort? ere is the case where one generates desire,
endeavors, activates persistence, upholds, & exerts one’s intent for the sake of the
non-arising of evil, unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen… for the sake of
the abandoning of evil, unskillful qualities that have arisen… for the sake of the


178

arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen… (and) for the maintenance,
non-confusion, increase, plenitude, development, & culmination of skillful
qualities that have arisen: is is called right eﬀort.” — SN 45:8

§23. “And how is striving fruitful, how is exertion fruitful? ere is the case
where a monk, when not loaded down, does not load himself down with pain,
nor does he reject pleasure that accords with the Dhamma, although he is not
xated on that pleasure. He discerns that ‘When I exert a [bodily, verbal, or
mental] fabrication against this cause of stress, then from the fabrication of
exertion there is dispassion. When I look on with equanimity at that cause of
stress, then from the development of equanimity there is dispassion.’ So he exerts
a fabrication against the ( rst) cause of stress… and develops equanimity with
regard to the (second) cause of stress… us the stress [coming from any cause of
the rst sort] is exhausted… and the stress [coming from any cause of the second
sort] is exhausted.” — MN 101

§24. On that occasion Ven. Soṇa was staying near Rājagaha in the Cool
Wood. en, as Ven. Soṇa was meditating in seclusion [a er doing walking
meditation until the skin of his soles was split & bleeding], this train of thought
arose in his awareness: “Of the Blessed One’s disciples who have aroused their
persistence, I am one, but my mind is not released from eﬄuents through lack of
clinging/sustenance. Now, my family has enough wealth that it would be possible
to enjoy wealth & make merit. What if I were to disavow the training, return to
the lower life, enjoy wealth, & make merit?”
en the Blessed One, as soon as he perceived with his awareness the train of
thought in Ven. Soṇa’s awareness disappeared from Vulture Peak Mountain—just
as a strong man might extend his exed arm or ex his extended arm—appeared
in the Cool Wood right in front of Ven. Soṇa, and sat down on a prepared seat.
Ven. Soṇa, a er bowing down to the Blessed One, sat to one side. As he was
sitting there, the Blessed One said to him, “Just now, as you were meditating in
seclusion, didn’t this train of thought appear to your awareness: ‘Of the Blessed
One’s disciples who have aroused their persistence, I am one, but my mind is not
released from eﬄuents.… What if I were to disavow the training, return to the
lower life, enjoy wealth, & make merit?’”
“Yes, lord.”


179

“Now, what do you think, Soṇa. Before, when you were a house-dweller, were
you skilled at playing the vina?”
“Yes, lord.”
“And what do you think: When the strings of your vina were too taut, was
your vina in tune & playable?”
“No, lord.”
“And what do you think: When the strings of your vina were too loose, was
your vina in tune & playable?”
“No, lord.”
“And what do you think: When the strings of your vina were neither too taut
nor too loose, but tuned to be right on pitch, was your vina in tune & playable?”
“Yes, lord.”
“In the same way, Soṇa, over-aroused persistence leads to restlessness, overly
slack persistence leads to laziness. us you should determine the right pitch for
your persistence, attune the pitch of the ( ve) faculties (to that), and there pick
up your theme.”
“Yes, lord,” Ven. Soṇa answered the Blessed One. en, having given this
exhortation to Ven. Soṇa, the Blessed One—as a strong man might extend his
exed arm or ex his extended arm—disappeared from the Cool Wood and
appeared on Vulture Peak Mountain.
So, a er that, Ven. Soṇa determined the right pitch for his persistence,
attuned the pitch of the ( ve) faculties (to that), and there picked up his theme.
Dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, & resolute, he in no long time reached
& remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go
forth from home into homelessness, knowing & realizing it for himself in the
here & now. He knew: “Birth is ended, the holy life ful lled, the task done. ere
is nothing further for the sake of this world.” And thus Ven. Soṇa became another
one of the arahants. — AN 6:55

III. RELINQUISHMENT

§25. If, by forsaking
a limited ease,
he would see


180

an abundance of ease,
the enlightened man
would forsake
the limited ease
for the sake
of the abundant. — Dhp 290

§26. Ven. Suppiya:
I’ll make a trade:
aging for the ageless,
burning for the unbound:
the highest peace,
the unexcelled rest
from the yoke. — ag 1:32


Giving

§27. As he was sitting to one side, King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed
One: “Where, lord, should a gi be given?”
“Wherever the mind feels con dence, great king.”
“But a gi given where, lord, bears great fruit?”
“ is (question) is one thing, great king—‘Where should a gi be given?’—
while this—‘A gi given where bears great fruit?’—is something else entirely.
What is given to a virtuous person—rather than to an unvirtuous one—bears
great fruit.” — SN 3:24

§28. “One who is generous, a master of giving, is dear & charming to people
at large… this is a fruit of giving visible in the here & now.
“And further, good people, people of integrity, admire one who is generous, a
master of giving… this, too, is a fruit of giving visible in the here & now.
“And further, the ne reputation of one who is generous, a master of giving, is
spread far & wide… this, too, is a fruit of giving visible in the here & now.
“And further, when one who is generous, a master of giving, approaches any
assembly of people—noble warriors, brahmans, householders, or contemplatives


181

—he/she does so con dently & without embarrassment… this, too, is a fruit of
giving visible in the here & now.
“And further, at the break-up of the body, a er death, one who is generous, a
master of giving, reappears in a good destination, the heavenly world… this is a

§29. “A person of integrity gives a gi with a sense of conviction. A person of
integrity gives a gi attentively. A person of integrity gives a gi in season. A
person of integrity gives a gi with an empathetic heart. A person of integrity
gives a gi without adversely aﬀecting himself or others.
“Having given a gi with a sense of conviction, he—wherever the result of
that gi ripens—is rich, with much wealth, with many possessions. And he is
well-built, handsome, extremely inspiring, endowed with a lotus-like complexion.
“Having given a gi attentively, he—wherever the result of that gi ripens—is
rich, with much wealth, with many possessions. And his children, wives, slaves,
servants, and workers listen carefully to him, lend him their ears, and serve him
with understanding hearts.
“Having given a gi in season, he—wherever the result of that gi ripens—is
rich, with much wealth, with many possessions. And his goals are ful lled in
season.
“Having given a gi with an empathetic heart, he—wherever the result of that
gi ripens—is rich, with much wealth, with many possessions. And his mind
inclines to the enjoyment of the ve strings of lavish sensuality.
“Having given a gi without adversely aﬀecting himself or others, he—
wherever the result of that gi ripens—is rich, with much wealth, with many
possessions. And not from anywhere does destruction come to his property—
whether from re, from water, from kings, from thieves, or from hateful heirs.

great bene t?”

attached (to the reward), seeking to store up for oneself, (with the thought), ‘I’ll
enjoy this a er death’—on the break-up of the body, a er death, one reappears in

“And which are the three factors of the donor? ere is the case where the

“Just as it’s not easy to take the measure of the great ocean as ‘just this many
buckets of water, just this many hundreds of buckets of water, just this many
thousands of buckets of water, or just this many hundreds of thousands of
buckets of water.’ It’s simply reckoned as a great mass of water, incalculable,
immeasurable. In the same way, it’s not easy to take the measure of the merit of a
donation thus endowed with six factors as ‘just this much a bonanza of merit, a
bonanza of what is skillful—a nutriment of bliss, heavenly, resulting in bliss,
leading to heaven—that leads to what is desirable, pleasing, charming, bene cial,

Renunciation

§33. “ ere are these ve strings of sensuality. Which ve? Forms cognizable
via the eye—agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, enticing, linked with
sensual desire; sounds cognizable via the ear… aromas cognizable via the nose…
avors cognizable via the tongue… tactile sensations cognizable via the body—
agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, enticing, linked with sensual desire. But



184

these are not sensuality.   ey are called strings of sensuality in the discipline of
the noble ones.
e passion for one’s resolves is a person’s sensuality,
not the beautiful sensual pleasures
found in the world.
e passion for one’s resolves is a person’s sensuality.
e beauties remain as they are in the world,
while the enlightened, in this regard,
subdue their desire. — AN 6:63

§34. “Even though a disciple of the noble ones has clearly seen as it has come
to be with right discernment that sensuality is of much stress, much despair, &
greater drawbacks, still—if he has not attained a rapture & pleasure apart from
sensuality, apart from unskillful mental qualities, or something more peaceful
than that—he can be tempted by sensuality. But when he has clearly seen as it has
come to be with right discernment that sensuality is of much stress, much despair,
& greater drawbacks, and he has attained a rapture & pleasure apart from
sensuality, apart from unskillful qualities, or something more peaceful than that,
he cannot be tempted by sensuality.” — MN 14

§35. On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Āḷavī on a spread of
leaves by a cattle track in a siṁsapā forest. en Hatthaka of Āḷavī, out roaming &
rambling for exercise, saw the Blessed One sitting on a spread of leaves by the
cattle track in the siṁsapā forest. On seeing him, he went to him and, on arrival,
having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the
Blessed One, “Lord, I hope the Blessed One has slept in ease.”
“Yes, young man. I have slept in ease. Of those in the world who sleep in ease, I
am one.”
“But cold, lord, is the winter night. e ‘Between-the-Eights’ [a period in
February] is a time of snowfall. Hard is the ground trampled by cattle hooves.
in is the spread of leaves. Sparse are the leaves in the trees. in are your ochre
robes. And cold blows the Verambā wind. Yet still the Blessed One says, ‘Yes,
young man. I have slept in ease. Of those in the world who sleep in ease, I am
one.’”



185

“In that case, young man, I will question you in return. Answer as you see t.
Now, what do you think? Suppose a householder or householder’s son has a
house with a gabled roof, plastered inside & out, dra -free, with close- tting
door & windows shut against the wind. Inside he has a throne-like bed spread
with a long- eeced coverlet, a white wool coverlet, an embroidered coverlet, a rug
of kadali-deer hide, with a canopy above, & red cushions on either side. And
there a lamp would be burning, and his four wives, with their many charms,
would be attending to him. Would he sleep in ease, or not? Or how does this
strike you?”
“Yes, lord, he would sleep in ease. Of those in the world who sleep in ease, he
would be one.”
“But what do you think, young man. Might there arise in that householder or
householder’s son any bodily fevers or fevers of mind born of passion so that—
burned with those passion-born fevers—he would sleep miserably?”
“Yes, lord.”
“As for those passion-born fevers—burned with which the householder or
householder’s son would sleep miserably—that passion has been abandoned by
the Tathāgata, its root destroyed, made like a palmyra stump, deprived of the
conditions of existence, not destined for future arising. erefore he sleeps in
ease.”
[Similarly with aversion and delusion.] — AN 3:35

§36. “Now, there is the case where a monk—quite secluded from sensuality,
secluded from unskillful qualities—enters & remains in the rst jhāna: rapture &
pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation. If, as
he remains there, he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with sensuality,
that is an aﬄiction for him. Just as pain would arise in a healthy person as an
aﬄiction, even so the attention to perceptions dealing with sensuality that beset
the monk is an aﬄiction for him.” — AN 9:34

§37. “And how is striving fruitful, how is exertion fruitful? ere is the case
where a monk… notices this: ‘When I live according to my pleasure, unskillful
mental qualities increase in me & skillful qualities decline. When I exert myself
with stress & pain, though, unskillful qualities decline in me & skillful qualities
increase. Why don’t I exert myself with stress & pain?’ So he exerts himself with


186

stress & pain, and while he is exerting himself with stress & pain, unskillful
qualities decline in him, & skillful qualities increase. en at a later time he
would no longer exert himself with stress & pain. Why is that? Because he has
attained the goal for which he was exerting himself with stress & pain.…
“Suppose that a etcher were to heat & warm an arrow sha between two
ames, making it straight & pliable. en at a later time he would no longer heat
& warm the sha between two ames, making it straight & pliable. Why is that?
Because he has attained the goal for which he was heating & warming the sha .…
In the same way, the monk… no longer exerts himself with stress & pain. Why is
that? Because he has attained the goal for which he was exerting himself with
stress & pain.” — MN 101

Endurance

§39. I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near
Rājagaha at the Maddakucchi Deer Reserve. Now, at that time his foot had been
pierced by a stone sliver [a er Devadatta had tried to kill him by rolling a boulder
down a hillside]. Excruciating were the bodily feelings that developed within him
—painful, erce, sharp, wracking, repellent, disagreeable—but he endured them
mindful, alert, & unperturbed. Having had his outer robe folded in four and laid
out, he lay down on his right side in the lion’s posture—with one foot placed on
top of the other—mindful & alert.
en Māra the Evil One went to the Blessed One and recited this verse in his
presence:
“Are you lying there in a stupor,
or drunk on poetry?
Are your goals so very few?



187

All alone in a secluded lodging,
what is this dreamer, this sleepy-face?”
e Buddha:
“I lie here,
not in a stupor,
nor drunk on poetry.
My goal attained,
I am sorrow-free.
All alone in a secluded lodging,
I lie down with sympathy
for all beings.
Even those pierced in the chest
with an arrow,
their hearts rapidly,
rapidly beating:
Even they with their arrows
are able to sleep.
So why shouldn’t I,
with my arrow removed?
I’m not awake with worry,
nor afraid to sleep.
Days & nights
don’t oppress me.
I see no threat of decline
in any world at all.
at’s why I sleep
with sympathy
for all beings.”
en Māra the Evil One—sad & dejected at realizing, “ e Blessed One
knows me; the One Well-Gone knows me”—vanished right there. — SN 4:13

§40. “Once, monks, in this same Sāvatthī, there was a lady of a household
named Vedehikā. is good report about Lady Vedehikā had circulated: ‘Lady
Vedehikā is gentle. Lady Vedehikā is even-tempered. Lady Vedehikā is calm.’


188

Now, Lady Vedehikā had a slave named Kālī who was diligent, de , & neat in her
work. e thought occurred to Kālī the slave: ‘ is good report about my Lady
Vedehikā has circulated: “Lady Vedehikā is even-tempered. Lady Vedehikā is
gentle. Lady Vedehikā is calm.” Now, is anger present in my lady without
showing, or is it absent? Or is it just because I’m diligent, de , & neat in my work
that the anger present in my lady doesn’t show? Why don’t I test her?’
“So Kālī the slave got up a er daybreak. en Lady Vedehikā said to her:
‘Hey, Kālī!’
“‘Yes, madam?’
“‘Why did you get up a er daybreak?’
“‘No reason, madam.’
“‘No reason, you wicked slave, and yet you get up a er daybreak?’ Angered &
displeased, she scowled.
en the thought occurred to Kālī the slave: ‘Anger is present in my lady
without showing, and not absent. And it’s just because I’m diligent, de , & neat
in my work that the anger present in my lady doesn’t show. Why don’t I test her
some more?’
“So Kālī the slave got up later in the day. en Lady Vedehikā said to her:
‘Hey, Kālī!’
“‘Yes, madam?’
“‘Why did you get up later in the day?’
“‘No reason, madam.’
“‘No reason, you wicked slave, and yet you get up later in the day?’ Angered &
displeased, she grumbled.

189

“‘No reason, you wicked slave, and yet you get up even later in the day?’
Angered & displeased, she grabbed hold of a rolling pin and gave her a whack
over the head, cutting it open.
en Kālī the slave, with blood streaming from her cut-open head, went and
denounced her mistress to the neighbors: ‘See, ladies, the gentle one’s handiwork?
See the even-tempered one’s handiwork? See the calm one’s handiwork? How
could she, angered & displeased with her only slave for getting up a er daybreak,
grab hold of a rolling pin and give her a whack over the head, cutting it open?’
A er that this evil report about Lady Vedehikā circulated: ‘Lady Vedehikā is
vicious. Lady Vedehikā is foul-tempered. Lady Vedehikā is violent.’
“In the same way, monks, a monk may be ever so gentle, ever so even-
tempered, ever so calm, as long as he is not touched by disagreeable aspects of
speech. But it is only when disagreeable aspects of speech touch him that he can
truly be known as gentle, even-tempered, & calm. I don’t call a monk easy to
admonish if he is easy to admonish and makes himself easy to admonish only by
reason of robes, almsfood, lodging, & medicinal requisites for curing the sick.
Why is that? Because if he doesn’t get robes, almsfood, lodging, & medicinal
requisites for curing the sick, then he isn’t easy to admonish and doesn’t make
himself easy to admonish. But if a monk is easy to admonish and makes himself
easy to admonish purely out of esteem for the Dhamma, respect for the Dhamma,
reverence for the Dhamma, then I call him easy to admonish. us, monks, you
should train yourselves: ‘We will be easy to admonish and make ourselves easy to
admonish purely out of esteem for the Dhamma, respect for the Dhamma,
reverence for the Dhamma.’ at’s how you should train yourselves.
“Monks, there are these ve aspects of speech by which others may address
you: timely or untimely, true or false, aﬀectionate or harsh, bene cial or
unbene cial, with a mind of goodwill or with inner hate. Others may address you
in a timely way or an untimely way. ey may address you with what is true or
what is false. ey may address you in an aﬀectionate way or a harsh way. ey
may address you in a bene cial way or an unbene cial way. ey may address you
with a mind of goodwill or with inner hate. In any event, you should train
yourselves: ‘Our minds will be unaﬀected and we will say no evil words. We will
remain sympathetic to that person’s welfare, with a mind of goodwill, and with
no inner hate. We will keep pervading him with an awareness imbued with
goodwill and, beginning with him, we will keep pervading the all-encompassing


190

world with an awareness imbued with goodwill—abundant, expansive,
immeasurable, free from hostility, free from ill will.’ at’s how you should train
yourselves.
“Suppose that a man were to come along carrying a hoe & a basket, saying, ‘I
will make this great earth be without earth.’ He would dig here & there, scatter
soil here & there, spit here & there, urinate here & there, saying, ‘Be without
earth. Be without earth.’ Now, what do you think—would he make this great
earth be without earth?”
“No, lord. Why is that? Because this great earth is deep & enormous. It can’t
easily be made to be without earth. e man would reap only a share of weariness
& disappointment.”
“In the same way, monks, there are these ve aspects of speech by which others
may address you.… In any event, you should train yourselves: ‘Our minds will be
unaﬀected and we will say no evil words. We will remain sympathetic to that
person’s welfare, with a mind of goodwill, and with no inner hate. We will keep
pervading him with an awareness imbued with goodwill and, beginning with
him, we will keep pervading the all-encompassing world with an awareness
imbued with goodwill equal to the great earth—abundant, expansive,
immeasurable, free from hostility, free from ill will.’ at’s how you should train
yourselves.…
“Monks, even if bandits were to carve you up savagely, limb by limb, with a
two-handled saw, he among you who let his heart get angered even at that would
not be doing my bidding. Even then you should train yourselves: ‘Our minds will
be unaﬀected and we will say no evil words. We will remain sympathetic, with a

with an awareness imbued with goodwill and, beginning with them, we will keep
pervading the entire world with an awareness imbued with goodwill—abundant,
expansive, immeasurable, free from hostility, free from ill will.’ at’s how you

“Monks, if you attend constantly to this admonition on the simile of the saw,

§41. “And what are the eﬄuents to be abandoned by tolerating? ere is the
case where a monk, re ecting appropriately, endures. He tolerates cold, heat,
hunger, & thirst; the touch of ies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, & reptiles; ill-spoken,
unwelcome words & bodily feelings that, when they arise, are painful, racking,
sharp, piercing, disagreeable, displeasing, & menacing to life. e eﬄuents,
vexation, or fever that would arise if he were not to tolerate these things do not
arise for him when he tolerates them. ese are called the eﬄuents to be
abandoned by tolerating.
“And what are the eﬄuents to be abandoned by avoiding? ere is the case
where a monk, re ecting appropriately, avoids a wild elephant, a wild horse, a
wild bull, a wild dog, a snake, a stump, a bramble patch, a chasm, a cliﬀ, a
cesspool, an open sewer. Re ecting appropriately, he avoids sitting in the sorts of
unsuitable seats, wandering to the sorts of unsuitable habitats, and associating
with the sorts of bad friends that would make his knowledgeable friends in the
holy life suspect him of evil conduct. e eﬄuents, vexation, or fever that would
arise if he were not to avoid these things do not arise for him when he avoids
them. ese are called the eﬄuents to be abandoned by avoiding.
“And what are the eﬄuents to be abandoned by destroying? ere is the case
where a monk, re ecting appropriately, does not tolerate an arisen thought of
sensuality. He abandons it, destroys it, dispels it, & wipes it out of existence.
“Re ecting appropriately, he does not tolerate an arisen thought of ill will… an
arisen thought of harmfulness…
“Re ecting appropriately, he does not tolerate arisen evil, unskillful mental
qualities. He abandons them, destroys them, dispels them, & wipes them out of

Equanimity

§42. “Now, what is worldly equanimity? ere are these ve strings of
sensuality. Which ve? Forms cognizable via the eye—agreeable, pleasing,
charming, endearing, enticing, linked with sensual desire; sounds cognizable via
the ear… aromas cognizable via the nose… avors cognizable via the tongue…
tactile sensations cognizable via the body—agreeable, pleasing, charming,


192

endearing, enticing, linked with sensual desire. Any equanimity arising in
dependence on these ve strings of sensuality is called worldly equanimity.
“And what is unworldly equanimity? ere is the case where, with the
abandoning of pleasure & pain—as with the earlier disappearance of elation &
distress—one enters & remains in the fourth jhāna: purity of equanimity &
mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. is is called unworldly equanimity.”
“And what is the even more unworldly unworldly equanimity? Any
equanimity that arises in one eﬄuent-free while he/she is re ecting on his/her
mind that is released from greed, released from aversion, released from delusion:
is is called an even more unworldly unworldly equanimity.” — SN 36:31

§43. “Just as if a goldsmith or goldsmith’s apprentice were to set up a smelter.
Having set up the smelter, he would re the receptacle. Having red the
receptacle, he would take hold of some gold with his tongs and place it in the
receptacle. Periodically he would blow on it, periodically sprinkle it with water,
periodically examine it closely. If he were solely to blow on it, it’s possible that the
gold would burn up. If he were solely to sprinkle it with water, it’s possible that
the gold would grow cold. If he were solely to examine it closely, it’s possible that
the gold would not come to full perfection. But when he periodically blows on it,
periodically sprinkles it with water, periodically examines it closely, the gold
becomes pliant, malleable, & luminous. It is not brittle, and is ready to be
worked. en whatever sort of ornament he has in mind—whether a belt, an
earring, a necklace, or a gold chain—the gold would serve his purpose.
“In the same way, a monk intent on heightened mind should attend
periodically to three themes: He should attend periodically to the theme of
concentration; he should attend periodically to the theme of upli ed energy; he
should attend periodically to the theme of equanimity. If the monk intent on
heightened mind were to attend solely to the theme of concentration, it’s possible
that his mind would tend to laziness. If he were to attend solely to the theme of
upli ed energy, it’s possible that his mind would tend to restlessness. If he were to
attend solely to the theme of equanimity, it’s possible that his mind would not be
rightly concentrated for the ending of the eﬄuents. But when he attends
periodically to the theme of concentration, attends periodically to the theme of
upli ed energy, attends periodically to the theme of equanimity, his mind is



193

pliant, malleable, luminous, and not brittle. It is rightly concentrated for the
ending of the eﬄuents.” — AN 3:103

§44. “ ere is equanimity coming from multiplicity, dependent on
multiplicity; and there is equanimity coming from singleness, dependent on
singleness.
“And what is equanimity coming from multiplicity, dependent on
multiplicity? ere is equanimity with regard to forms, equanimity with regard
to sounds… smells… tastes… tactile sensations [& ideas: this word appears in one
of the recensions]. is is equanimity coming from multiplicity, dependent on
multiplicity.
“And what is equanimity coming from singleness, dependent on singleness?
ere is equanimity dependent on the dimension of the in nitude of space,
equanimity dependent on the dimension of the in nitude of consciousness…
dependent on the dimension of nothingness… dependent on the dimension of
neither perception nor non-perception. is is equanimity coming from
singleness, dependent on singleness.
“By depending & relying on equanimity coming from singleness, dependent
on singleness, abandon & transcend equanimity coming from multiplicity,
dependent on multiplicity. Such is its abandoning, such its transcending.
“By depending & relying on non-fashioning [atammayatā], abandon &
transcend the equanimity coming from singleness, dependent on singleness. Such
is its abandoning, such its transcending.” — MN 137

§45. To purify the heart, we have to disentangle our attachments to self, to the
body, to mental phenomena, and to all the objects that come passing in through
the senses. Keep the mind intent on concentration. Keep it one at all times. Don’t
let it become two, three, four, ve, etc., because once you’ve made the mind one,
it’s easy to make it zero. Simply cut oﬀ the little ‘head’ and pull the two ends
together. But if you let the mind become many, it’s a long, diﬃcult job to make it
zero.
And another thing: If you put the zero a er other numbers, they become ten,
twenty, thirty, forty, y, hundreds, thousands, on to in nity. But if you put the
zeros rst, even if you have ten thousand of them, they don’t count. So it is with
the heart: Once we’ve turned it from one to zero and put the zero rst, then other


194

people can praise or criticize us as they like but it won’t count. Good doesn’t
count, bad doesn’t count. is is something that can’t be written, can’t be read,
that we can understand only for ourselves. — Phra Ajaan Lee: Inner Strength
