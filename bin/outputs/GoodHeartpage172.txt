a knife to stab his shadow, how is he going to die? In the same way, ignorant
people try to destroy the shadows of stress and don’t get anywhere. As for the
essence of stress in the heart, they don’t think of remedying it at all. is lack of
awareness on their part is one form of avijjā, or ignorance. — Phra Ajaan Lee:

      §10. All
      tremble at the rod,
         all
      are fearful of death.
      Drawing the parallel to
         yourself,
      neither kill nor get others to kill. — Dhp 129

      §11. ink: “Happy, at rest,
      may all beings be happy at heart.
      Whatever beings there may be,
         weak or strong, without exception,
         long, large,
         middling, short,
         subtle, blatant,
         seen & unseen,
         near & far,
         born & seeking birth:
      May all beings be happy at heart.
      Let no one deceive another
      or despise anyone anywhere,
      or through anger or resistance
      wish for another to suﬀer.”
      As a mother would risk her life
      to protect her child, her only child,
      even so should one cultivate the heart limitlessly
         with regard to all beings. — Sn 1:8
