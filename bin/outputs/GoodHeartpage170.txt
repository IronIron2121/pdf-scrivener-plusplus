    §6. “‘ is noble truth of stress is to be comprehended’ … ‘ is noble truth of
the origination of stress is to be abandoned’ … ‘ is noble truth of the cessation
of stress is to be realized’ … ‘ is noble truth of the way of practice leading to the
cessation of stress is to be developed.’” — SN 56:11

    §7. “As for the course of action that is unpleasant to do but that, when done,
leads to what is pro table, it is in light of this course of action that one may be
known—in terms of manly stamina, manly persistence, manly eﬀort—as a fool or
a wise person. For a fool doesn’t re ect, ‘Even though this course of action is
unpleasant to do, still when it is done it leads to what is pro table.’ So he doesn’t
do it, and thus the non-doing of that course of action leads to what is unpro table
for him. But a wise person re ects, ‘Even though this course of action is
unpleasant to do, still when it is done it leads to what is pro table.’ So he does it,
and thus the doing of that course of action leads to what is pro table for him.

    §8. What does discernment come from? You might compare it with learning
to become a potter, a tailor, or a basket weaver. e teacher will start out by
telling you how to make a pot, sew a shirt or a pair of pants, or weave diﬀerent
patterns, but the proportions and beauty of the object you make will have to
depend on your own powers of observation. Suppose you weave a basket and then
take a good look at its proportions, to see if it’s too short or too tall. If it’s too
short, weave another one, a little taller, and then take a good look at it to see if
there’s anything that still needs improving, to see if it’s too thin or too fat. en
weave another one, better-looking than the last. Keep this up until you have one
that’s as beautiful and well-proportioned as possible, one with nothing to criticize
