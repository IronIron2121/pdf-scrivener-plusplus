arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen… (and) for the maintenance,
non-confusion, increase, plenitude, development, & culmination of skillful
qualities that have arisen: is is called right eﬀort.” — SN 45:8

    §23. “And how is striving fruitful, how is exertion fruitful? ere is the case
where a monk, when not loaded down, does not load himself down with pain,
nor does he reject pleasure that accords with the Dhamma, although he is not
  xated on that pleasure. He discerns that ‘When I exert a [bodily, verbal, or
mental] fabrication against this cause of stress, then from the fabrication of
exertion there is dispassion. When I look on with equanimity at that cause of
stress, then from the development of equanimity there is dispassion.’ So he exerts
a fabrication against the ( rst) cause of stress… and develops equanimity with
regard to the (second) cause of stress… us the stress [coming from any cause of
the rst sort] is exhausted… and the stress [coming from any cause of the second
sort] is exhausted.” — MN 101

    §24. On that occasion Ven. Soṇa was staying near Rājagaha in the Cool
Wood. en, as Ven. Soṇa was meditating in seclusion [a er doing walking
meditation until the skin of his soles was split & bleeding], this train of thought
arose in his awareness: “Of the Blessed One’s disciples who have aroused their
persistence, I am one, but my mind is not released from eﬄuents through lack of
clinging/sustenance. Now, my family has enough wealth that it would be possible
to enjoy wealth & make merit. What if I were to disavow the training, return to
the lower life, enjoy wealth, & make merit?”
       en the Blessed One, as soon as he perceived with his awareness the train of
thought in Ven. Soṇa’s awareness disappeared from Vulture Peak Mountain—just
as a strong man might extend his exed arm or ex his extended arm—appeared
in the Cool Wood right in front of Ven. Soṇa, and sat down on a prepared seat.
Ven. Soṇa, a er bowing down to the Blessed One, sat to one side. As he was
sitting there, the Blessed One said to him, “Just now, as you were meditating in
seclusion, didn’t this train of thought appear to your awareness: ‘Of the Blessed
One’s disciples who have aroused their persistence, I am one, but my mind is not
released from eﬄuents.… What if I were to disavow the training, return to the
lower life, enjoy wealth, & make merit?’”
    “Yes, lord.”
