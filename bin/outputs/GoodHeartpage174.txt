   “One sleeps easily, wakes easily, dreams no evil dreams. One is dear to human
beings, dear to non-human beings. e devas protect one. Neither re, poison,
nor weapons can touch one. One’s mind gains concentration quickly. One’s
complexion is bright. One dies unconfused and—if penetrating no higher—is
headed for a Brahmā world.” — AN 11:16

II. TRUTH

   §15. “Let an observant person come—one who is not fraudulent, not
deceitful, one of a straightforward nature. I instruct him. I teach him the
Dhamma. Practicing as instructed, he in no long time knows for himself, sees for

    “Y es, Master Gotama, to this extent there is the guarding of the truth. To this
